            "therapeutic_indications": "The primary medical purpose for which stem bromelain SB is currently indicated for is the removal of eschar in adults with deep partial and full thickness thermal burns FDA Label Besides this official indication however it is also believed that SB may be used as a treatment for several other purposes as well including cardiovascular health osteoarthritis autoimmunity blood clotting diarrhea cancer surgery and debridement although the specific mechanisms of action for these indications remain to be elucidated A27198",

                "disease": "The human body can seemingly absorb significant amounts of bromelain about 12 grams day of bromelain may be consumed without the appearance of any major adverse effects A27198 Another study suggests that after giving bromelain 3000 FIP unit day to human over a period of ten days discovered no significant changes in blood coagulation parameters A27198 Finally stem bromelain has a relatively low toxicity with an LD50 greater than 10 g kg in mice rats and rabbits A27198",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Stem bromelain is ultimately a mixture of various different thiol endopeptidases A27198 that are capable of catalyzing a range of reactions on a number of different substrates which is perhaps why stem bromelain can evidently be used as some manner of treatment in a range of therapeutic contexts This notion is facilitated by the fact that various topical and oral administration stem bromelain preparations exist as well further diversifying the ways in which the medication can be used Perhaps the most important aspect of stem bromelain however is its ability to undergo intestinal absorption undegraded in a functionally intact form ultimately preserving its proteolytic actions in the plasma A27198 A32644 This kind of pharmacodynamic characteristic is another element that perhaps allows stem bromelain to remain active within the body and elicit a number of actions at several major body systems",
