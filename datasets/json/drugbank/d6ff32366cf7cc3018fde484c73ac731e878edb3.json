                "pharmacodynamics": "Finasteride is an antiandrogenic compound that works by suppressing the production of serum and intraprostatic dihydrotestosterone DHT in men via inhibiting the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of DHT The maximum effect of a rapid reduction in serum DHT concentration is expected to be observed 8 hours following administration of the first dose L10565 In a single man receiving a single oral dose of 5 mg finasteride for up to 4 years there was a reduction in the serum DHT concentrations by approximately 70 and the median circulating level of testosterone increased by approximately 10 20 within the physiologic range L10565 In a double blind placebo controlled study finasteride reduced intraprostatic DHT level by 91 4 but finasteride is not expected to decrease the DHT levels to castrate levels since circulating testosterone is also converted to DHT by the type 1 isoenzyme expressed in other tissues A2132 It is expected that DHT levels return to normal within 14 days upon discontinuation of the drug L6244 In a study of male patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia prior to prostatectomy the treatment with finasteride resulted in an approximate 80 lower DHT content was measured in prostatic tissue removed at surgery compared to placebo L10565 While finasteride reduces the size of the prostate gland by 20 this may not correlate well with improvement in symptoms A178273 The effects of finasteride are reported to be more pronounced in male patients with enlarged prostates 25 mL who are at the greatest risk of disease progression A2132 In phase III clinical studies oral administration of finasteride in male patients with male pattern hair loss promoted hair growth and prevented further hair loss by 66 and 83 of the subjects respectively which lasted during two years treatment A178222 The incidences of these effects in treatment groups were significantly higher than that of the group receiving a placebo A178222 Following finasteride administration the levels of DHT in the scalp skin was shown to be reduced by more than 60 indicating that the DHT found in scalp is derived from both local DHT production and circulating DHT A178195 The effect of finasteride on scalp DHT is likely seen because of its effect on both local follicular DHT levels as well as serum DHT levels A178195 There is evidence from early clinical observations and controlled studies that finasteride may reduce bleeding of prostatic origin A178183",
