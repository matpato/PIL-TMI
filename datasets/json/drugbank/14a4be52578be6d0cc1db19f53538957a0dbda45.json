            "therapeutic_indications": "Butamben was indicated for the treatment of chronic pain due to its long duration effect A32663 It is also indicated as a surface anesthetic for skin a mucous membrane and for the relief of pain and pruritus associated with anorectal disorders L2445",

                "disease": "In studies the most common effect was related to the generation of a prolonged effect It was also shown in preclinical trials to produce tissue necrosis and neuritis The LD50 of butamben is registered to be of 67 mg kg T175",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Butamben has been shown to selectively inhibit dorsal root pain signal transmission for periods of months when administered as epidural suspensions A27147 The effect of butamben is not related to any significant loss of motor function which indicates that it targets specifically the pain sensing C fibers of the dorsal root A32663 When administered topically butamben produced anesthesia by accumulating in the nerve cell membrane causing it to expand and lose its ability to depolarize and blocking the impulse transmission T172",
