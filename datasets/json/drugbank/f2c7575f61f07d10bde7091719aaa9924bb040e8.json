                "pharmacodynamics": "Cystic fibrosis CF is a disease characterized by the retention of viscous purulent secretions in the airways These thick secretions contribute both to reduced pulmonary function and to frequent pulmonary infection Purulent pulmonary secretions of individuals with cystic fibrosis contain very high concentrations of extracellular DNA released by degenerating leukocytes that accumulate in response to these infections Dornase alfa hydrolyzes the DNA in sputum of CF patients and reduces sputum viscosity and viscoelasticity The enzyme does not appear to affect sputum in the absence of an inflammatory response to infection nor does it affect the sputum of healthy individuals",
