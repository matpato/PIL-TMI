                "pharmacodynamics": "Compared to healthy children of the same age children with ADHD have lower circulating concentrations of omega 3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid These lipids found in the brain play an essential role in central nervous system development and function It has been reported that omega 3 fatty acid deficiency is directly associated with decreased brain phosphatidylserine which is mainly in the form of phosphatidylserine Omega 3 Ps Omega 3 L1500 L1502 PS Omega 3 such as Vayarin are believed to be essential in the functioning of neuronal cell membranes in activities such as signal transduction secretory vesicle release cell to cell communication and cell growth regulation Reduced levels of PS Omega 3 and omega 3 fatty acids may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ADHD and other neuronal disorders Vayarin is a proprietary lipid composition of phosphatidylserine Omega 3 PS Omega 3 enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid This formula has been designed to provide the essential lipids to brain tissues in order to support and maintain proper brain function Additionally the enrichment of EPA in the Vayarin medical food allows for better regulation of lipids and acts on the specific imbalances that are thought to be associated with ADHD A32047 L1500 Current studies are underway for the efficacy of Vayarin in ADHD and autism spectrum disorder co morbidity L1500 In addition studies of Vayarin in adults using MRI to study alterations in radiographic findings are currently underway allowing for other possible benefits of this medication L1501",
