                "pharmacodynamics": "Edotecarin formerly J 107088 is a novel non camptothecin DNA topoisomerase 1 inhibitor It is part of the class of compounds called indolocarbazoles It is a novel inhibitor of topoisomerase I that induces single strand DNA cleavage more effectively than NB 506 or camptothecin CPT and at different DNA sequences The DNA topoisomerase I complexes induced by edotecarin are more stable than those occurring after exposure to CPT or NB 506 The antitumor activity of edotecarin is less cell cycle dependent than other topoisomerase I inhibitors Being an indolocarbazole it is structurally related to staurosporine but does not possess protein kinase inhibitory properties The antitumor activity of edotecarin has been tested in vitro and in vivo and inhibition of tumor growth has been observed in breast cervix pharynx lung prostate colon gastric and hepatic cancer models Edotecarin is effective on cells that have acquired resistance related to P glycoprotein In vitro synergy has been demonstrated when edotecarin was tested in combination with cisplatin 5 fluorouracil etoposide paclitaxel doxorubicin vincristine CPT and gemcitabine",
