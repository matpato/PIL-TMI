                "pharmacodynamics": "It is thought that calcium glycerophosphate may act through a variety of mechanisms to produce an anti caries effect A27153 These include increasing acid resistance of the enamel increasing enamel mineralization modifying plaque acting as a pH buffer in plaque and elevating DB01373 and phosphate levels When used as an electrolyte replacement calcium glycerophosphate donates DB01373 and inorganic phosphate Calcium glycerophosphate is preferable to calcium phosphate due to its increased solubility Compared to combination calcium gluconate and potassium phosphate calcium glycerophosphate produces greater phosphate retention which allows for increased DB01373 retention and ultimately greater incorporation of the ions into bone structure A27152",
