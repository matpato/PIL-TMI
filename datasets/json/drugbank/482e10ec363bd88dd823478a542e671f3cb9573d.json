            "therapeutic_indications": "Currently in Phase III investigation for treatment of relapsed or refractory aggressive non Hodgkin s lymphoma in patients who have failed two prior lines of therapy Presently no standard therapy exists for patients with relapsed or refractory NHL 2 After first line therapy has been initiated most patients have received their lifetime limit of doxorubicin and further use of anthracyclines may potentially lead to anthracycline induced congestive heart failure CHF Pixantrone is an attractive alternative as a second line agent due to its lack of cardiac toxicity 2 The phase III trial PIX R is ongoing and will compare pixantrone multidrug therapy with an equivalent regimen in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma the most common type of NHL Previous study results have also suggested the possibility that pixantrone may be safe and effective in doxorubicin naive patients In myocardial strips which are doxorubicin naive pixantrone is taken up to a higher degree than in myocardial strips which are doxorubicin exposed and once absorbed exhibits redox inactivity 3 Pixantrone dimaleate has also been investigated as a treatment for acute myelogenous leukemia diffuse large B cell lymphoma follicular lymphoma metastatic breast cancer low grade small lymphocytic lymphomas and general metastatic cancers",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Pixantrone has a wide range of antitumor activity especially in terms of treating leukemias and lymphomas 3 Pixantrone lacks cardio toxic effects It has postulated that his is because of its redox inactivity and lack and inhibition of doxorubicinol formation in human myocardium 3",
