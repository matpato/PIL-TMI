            "therapeutic_indications": "Bovine thrombin is a topical thrombin indicated to aid hemostasis whenever oozing blood and minor bleeding from capillaries and small venules is accessible and control of bleeding by standard surgical techniques like suture ligature or cautery is ineffective or impractical FDA Label Additionally topical bovine thrombin can also be used in combination with an absorbable gelatin sponge USP FDA Label",

                "disease": "With regards to bovine thrombin no cases of overdose have been reported so far T155 Bovine thrombin however is capable of causing fatal severe bleeding or thrombosis FDA Label This thrombosis may result from the development of antibodies against bovine thrombin FDA Label Bleeding may result from the development of antibodies against bovine factor V FDA Label These antibodies may subsequently cross react with endogenous human factor V and lead to its deficiency FDA Label Patients who are know or suspected to have antibodies to bovine thrombin and or bovine factor V should not be re exposed to the product FDA Label Patients who are administered bovine thrombin should be monitored for abnormal coagulation laboratory values bleeding or indeed thrombosis FDA Label LD50 values are available for rat and mouse models where rat subcutaneous LD50 40mg kg rat IP LD50 40mg kg and mouse subcutaneous LD50 50 mg kg in which the greater than symbol indicates that the toxicity endpoint being tested was not achievable at the highest dose used in the test MSDS Regardless the most common adverse reactions following administration of bovine thrombin include hypersensitivity bleeding anemia post operative wound infection thromboembolic events hypotension pyrexia tachycardia and or thrombocytopenia FDA Label",
