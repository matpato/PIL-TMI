                "pharmacodynamics": "Omega 6 fatty acids mediate pro inflammatory effects in the cellular level and compete for the same rate limiting enzymes with omega 3 fatty acids Arachidonic acid is converted to inflammatory mediators such as omega 6 prostaglandins and leukotriene eicosanoids during the inflammatory cascade AA derived eicosanoids are proinflammatory but they have important homeostatic functions in regulating both the promotion and resolution of inflammation in the immune response It is reported that high intake of n 6 PUFA along with low intakes of n 3 PUFA shifts the physiological state to one that is proinflammatory and prothrombotic with increases in vasospasm vasoconstriction and blood viscosity and the development of diseases associated with these conditions Thus maintaining the balance between 2 polyunsaturated fatty acids is critical in inflammatory cascade regulation",
