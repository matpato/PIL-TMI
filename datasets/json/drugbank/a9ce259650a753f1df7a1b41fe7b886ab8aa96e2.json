                "pharmacodynamics": "Pimozide is an orally active antipsychotic drug product which shares with other antipsychotics the ability to blockade dopaminergic receptors on neurons in the central nervous system However receptor blockade is often accompanied by a series of secondary alterations in central dopamine metabolism and function which may contribute to both pimozide s therapeutic and untoward effects In addition pimozide in common with other antipsychotic drugs has various effects on other central nervous system receptor systems which are not fully characterized Pimozide also has less potential for inducing sedation and hypotension as it has more specific dopamine receptor blocking activity than other neuroleptic agents and is therefore a suitable alternative to haloperidol",
