            "therapeutic_indications": "For use in adults as an adjunct to surgery for subsequent removal of the tumour so as to prevent or delay amputation or in palliative care for irresectable soft tissue sarcoma of the limbs FDA Label Used in combination with melphalan via mild hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion",

                "disease": "In addition to its intended cytotoxic effects tasonermin produces secondary adverse effects Studies in mice rats dogs monkeys and rabbits observed hematological changes including anemia increased hematocrit and changes in leukocyte and platelet counts dependent on species and treatment duration FDA Label Tasonermin also produces decreases in blood pressure Increases in heart rate and reductions in cardiac contractility have been noted in some studies Increased liver enzymes suggest altered liver function as a result of tasonermin administration Changes in kidney function have also been observed including increased water and sodium excretion as well as increased serum urea and creatinine The only study to determine a no observable adverse effect level found the value to be 0 1 \u03bcg kg in monkeys during a 7 day course of tasonermin",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Tasonermin is thought to contribute to the destruction of tumor tissue via several direct and indirect effects FDA Label Tasonermin directly inhibits cell proliferation in a variety of cancer cells It also modifies endothelial cell morphology and reduces their proliferation in tumor microvasculature Modification of the expression of cell adhesion proteins proteins affecting coagulation interleukins and hematopoietic growth factors favors a procoagulant state resulting in microvascular thrombosis These changes also increase infiltration of the tumor tissue by leukocytes Monocytes macrophages and granulocytes are activated allowing better adherence to the endothelium and subjecting the tumor cells to phagocytosis and respiratory bursts as well as producing degranulation of immune cells to further enhance inflammatory activity Active antigen presenting cells are able to activate and induce proliferation of T and B lymphocyte cells to allow the adaptive immune system to contribute to tumor cell damage These changes lead to hemorraghic necrosis of the tumor",
