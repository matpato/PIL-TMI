            "therapeutic_indications": "Technetium 99m tetrofosmin is indicated for the diagnosis of heart abnormalities by exercise myocardial scintigraphy The exercise myocardial scintigraphy is an established method for the diagnosis of the severity of coronary artery disease A31592 This method allows distinguishing regions of reversible myocardial ischemia in the presence or absence of infarcted myocardium following rest and stress conditions L1147 The use of technetium 99m tetrofosmin is mainly used to assess myocardial perfusion in ischemia and infarction L1146",
            "contraindications": {
                "disease": "Technetium 99m tetrofosmin has a very high safety margin in both single and repeated dose intravenous administration It does not exhibit mutagenic potential in vitro and in vivo A31592 Reports have shown that technetium 99m tetrofosmin can cross the placenta thus the possibility of pregnancy should be assessed L1147",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Preclinical studies have reported that technetium 99m tetrofosmin presents a very good heart uptake and retention The diagnosis based on the presence of technetium 99m is considered to have a principal photon gamma emissions at 140 5 keV L1146 The imaging can be done at 15 minutes after stress and 30 60 minutes at rest but due to its slow wash out from myocardium it is possible to perform imaging for up to 4 hours post injection L1147 Administration of technetium 99m tetrofosmin generates a count elevation in white blood cell at 6 24 hours post injection A31592",
