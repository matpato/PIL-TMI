                "pharmacodynamics": "Thimerosal is an organomercurial compound and derivative of thiosalicyclic acid with antibacterial and antifungal properties L1672 Thimerosal which consists of approximately 50 mercury by weight has been one of the most widely used preservatives in vaccines It is metabolized degraded to ethylmercury and thiosalicylate Ethylmercury is an organomercurial that must be carefully distinguished from methylmercury a closely related substance that has been the focus of many studies Methylmercury is the type of mercury found in various species of fish L1688 Experimental data demonstrates that the toxicokinetics of thimerosal ethylmercury is vastly different from that of methyl mercury Thus methyl mercury is not a suitable reference for assessing the risk from exposure to thimerosal derived mercury L1692 Prior to the recent initiative to reduce or eliminate thimerosal from childhood vaccines the maximum cumulative exposure to mercury via routine childhood vaccinations during the first 6 months of life was 187 5 micrograms In the most recently formulated vaccines the maximum cumulative exposure during the first 6 months of life should now be less than 3 micrograms of mercury Currently thimerosal may still be used in the early stages of manufacturing of certain childhood vaccines however only a trace remains after a chemical purification process Note that the dose above is indicated for children 1 6 months of age is applicable only in the United States and other countries may have varying indications L1687",
