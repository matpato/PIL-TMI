            "therapeutic_indications": "This new application of calcium is intended for use as a food fortifier to fortify foods like sauces condiments beer beverages soft drinks milk and milk products soy milk and soy products with calcium nutrition L2765 Calcium levulinate can be used alone or with calcium lactate calcium chloride and other compounds either for pharmaceutical tablets capsules or injections preparation L2765 In essence calcium levulinate is ultimately a relatively new calcium supplementation option L2767",

                "pharmacodynamics": "The relatively new calcium levulinate is produced from a direct reaction between L or levulinic acid levulose and calcium hydroxide L2765 The resultant calcium levulinate formulation when used as a calcium supplement possesses a high calcium content that is observed to be 14 8 higher than the content typically found in calcium lactate L2765 Moreover this formulation also demonstrates a high solubility of more than 30 at 25 L2765 Furthermore the calcium levulinate is believed to be non toxic and non allergic making it especially suitable for injection or infusion administrations L2765 Additionally this levulinate formulation is reported as having a good taste little irritation with a pH value of 7 and good stability such that no precipitation or deterioration occurs during use L2765 Finally this calcium levulinate formulation is also believed to have good compatibility with calcium lactate calcium chloride and other material complexes which allows the formulation to also complex effectively with a diverse variety of foodstuffs and pharmaceutical dosage forms L2765",
