                "pharmacodynamics": "NSAIDs like nabumetone are well established as analgesics NSAIDs reduce both peripheral and central sensitization of nociceptive neurons due to inflammation which contribute to hyperalgesia and allodynia T116 A179023 This sensitization occurs through reducing the action potential threshold in peripheral neurons reducing the intensity of painful stimuli needed to produce a painful sensation Centrally activation of dorsal horn neurons occurs along with increased release of glutamate calcitonin gene related peptide CGRP and substance P which increase the transmission of painful stimuli Coupled with this is an inhibition glycinergic neurons which normally inhibit pain transmission a phenomenon known as disinhibition Increased activity ofn methyl d aspartate NMDA and \u03b1 amino 3 hydroxy 5 methyl 4 isoxazolepropionic acid AMPA receptors leads to the establishment of central sensitization allowing both mild painful and innocuous stimuli to produce action potentials in nociceptive projection neurons NSAIDs are effective in reducing mild moderate acute and chronic nociceptive pain however the usefulness of NSAIDs in neuropathic pain is limited The anti inflammatory effect of NSAIDs is mediated by preventing vasodilation increases in vascular permeability and the release of cytokines from endothelial cells T116 A179044 These three effects together prevent immunocompetent cells from migrating to the site of injury thereby preventing additional damage and inflammation due to activation of the immune system at the site of damage PGs also modulate T helper cell activation and differentiation an activity which is thought to be of importance in arthritic conditions The anti pyretic effect of NSAIDs is mediated through preventing increases in temperature by prostaglandins PGs via the hypothalamus T116 Activation of this process by other inflammatory mediators relies upon subsequent action by PGs therefore NSAIDs are able to reduce fever due to these mediators as well The adverse effects of NSAIDs are related to their therapeutic effects T116 The same vasodilatory action which occurs in inflammation also serves to regulate blood flow to the kidneys through the afferent renal arteries NSAIDs are widely known as nephrotoxic agents as the reduction in PGs produces vasoconstriction of these arteries resulting in reduced blood flow to the kidneys and a subsequent decline in renal function Reductions in mucus and HCO sub 3 sub sup sup secretion in the stomach increases the risk of ulceration by limiting the protection mediated by PGs Lastly COX 2 selective agents like nabumetone can unbalance prothrombotic and antithrombotic prostanoid generation leading to increased platelet aggregation and increased risk of thrombosis",
