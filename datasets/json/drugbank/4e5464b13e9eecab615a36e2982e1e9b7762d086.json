                "pharmacodynamics": "AMD 070 is a small molecule drug candidate that belongs to a new investigational class of anti HIV drugs known as entry fusion inhibitors Approximately 76 of HIV patients with measurable viral load are infected with a strain of virus that is resistant to one or more classes of antiretroviral agents thus reducing treatment options Unlike many existing HIV drugs that target the virus after it has infected a healthy cell AMD 070 blocks the virus from entering a healthy cell thus preventing the replication process AMD 070 targets the CXCR4 receptor on HIV and prevents the virus from entering and infecting healthy cells AMD 070 is specific for the CXCR4 receptor and does not interact with any other chemokine receptors in vitro AMD 070 strongly inhibits viral infection by all CXCR4 using virus including virus using CXCR4 alone and or virus using CXCR4 and CCR5 in vitro AMD 070 is orally bioavailable in animals Suitable PK and toxicity profile for oral dosing AMD 070 shows additive or synergistic effects in vitro in combination with other known anti HIV agents AMD 070 is active against CXCR4 using HIV strains that are resistant to existing antiretroviral therapies in vitro Potent anti HIV activity against CXCR4 using laboratory strains and clinical isolates",
