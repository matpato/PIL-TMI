                "pharmacodynamics": "Somatostatin is an endogenous peptide hormone that is secreted by the central nervous system gastrointestinal tract retina peripheral neurons and pancreatic D cells of the islets of Langerhans It exhibits several biological roles but predominantly exerts an inhibitory effect on secretion of other hormones and transmitters A20384 While distribution of two active isoforms of somatostatin is similar SST 14 is more predominant in the enteric neurons and peripheral nerves whereas SST 28 is more prominent in the retina and intestinal mucosal cells A20384 Anterior pituitary gland and brain It inhibits the release of growth hormones and thyroid stimulating hormones such as thyroid stimulating hormone TSH and thyrotrophin from the anterior pituitary while inhibiting the release of dopamine from the midbrain norepinephrine TRH and corticotrophin releasing hormone in the brain A20384 Pancreas In the pancreas somatostatin reduces the secretion of glucagon and insulin as well as bicarbonate ions and other enzymes A20384 T28 Thyroid gland Somatosatin reduces secretion of T3 T4 and calcitonin A20384 Somatostatin regulates the thyroid function by reducing basal TSH release T28 Gastrointestinal tract It attenuates the release of most gastrointestinal hormones such as gastrin secretin motilin gastric acid enteroglucagon cholecystokinin CCK vasoactive intestinal peptide VIP gastric inhibitory polypeptide GIP intrinsic factor pepsin neurotensin as well as bile secretion and colonic fluid secretion A20384 Adrenal gland It inhibits angiotensin II stimulated aldosterone secretion and acetylcholine induced medullary catecholamine secretion A20384 Eye retina Somatostatin inhibits the production of vascular endothelial growth factor A20384 Inflammatory cells and sensory nerves The expression of somatostatin has been found in inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes monocytes macrophages and endothelial cells to act as an autocrine or paracrine regulator in local immune responses Findings suggest that somatostatin may play a role in exerting local and systemic anti inflammatory and antinociceptive effects A20384 On primary afferent neurons somatostatin reduces the responses to thermal stimulation in C mechanoheat sensitive fibers in a dose dependent fashion and reduces the responses of C mechanoheat fibers to bradykinin induced excitation and sensitization to heat A32599 Somatostatin is reported to elicit an analgesic effect when applied intrathecally there is evidence supporting that similar effects may occur when systemically used to treat endocrine disorders T28 Somatostatin is thought to reduce bleeding from esophageal varices by causing splanchnic vasoconstriction A27145 Somatostatin elicits anti neoplastic actions on various tumours via direct or indirect effects or a combination of both A32595",
