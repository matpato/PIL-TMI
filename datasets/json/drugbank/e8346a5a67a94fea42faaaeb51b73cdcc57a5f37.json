                "pharmacodynamics": "Propylthiouracil is a thiourea antithyroid agent Grave s disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism It is an autoimmune disease where an individual s own antibodies attach to thyroid stimulating hormone receptors within cells of the thyroid gland and then trigger overproduction of thyroid hormone The two thyroid hormones manufactured by the thyroid gland thyroxine T4 and triiodothyronine T3 are formed by combining iodine and a protein called thyroglobulin with the assistance of an enzyme called peroxidase PTU inhibits iodine and peroxidase from their normal interactions with thyroglobulin to form T4 and T3 This action decreases thyroid hormone production PTU also interferes with the conversion of T4 to T3 and since T3 is more potent than T4 this also reduces the activity of thyroid hormones The actions and use of propylthiouracil are similar to those of methimazole",
