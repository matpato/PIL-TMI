                "pharmacodynamics": "Sertaconazole is an imidazole triazole type antifungal agent Sertaconazole is a highly selective inhibitor of fungal cytochrome P 450 sterol C 14 alpha demethylation via the inhibition of the enzyme cytochrome P450 14 alpha demethylase This enzyme converts lanosterol to ergosterol and is required in fungal cell wall synthesis The subsequent loss of normal sterols correlates with the accumulation of 14 alpha methyl sterols in fungi and may be partly responsible for the fungistatic activity of fluconazole Mammalian cell demethylation is much less sensitive to fluconazole inhibition Sertaconazole exhibits i in vitro i activity against i Cryptococcus neoformans i and i Candida spp i Fungistatic activity has also been demonstrated in normal and immunocompromised animal models for systemic and intracranial fungal infections due to i Cryptococcus neoformans i and for systemic infections due to Candida albicans",
