                "pharmacodynamics": "Indometacin is an NSAID with analgesic and antipyretic properties that exerts its pharmacological effects by inhibiting the synthesis of factors involved in pain fever and inflammation Its therapeutic action does not involve pituitary adrenal stimulation L6778 Indometacin primarily works by suppressing inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis by providing relief of pain as well as reducing fever swelling and tenderness This effectiveness has been demonstrated by a reduction in the extent of joint swelling the average number of joints displaying symptoms of inflammation and the severity of morning stiffness Increased mobility was demonstrated by a decrease in total walking time and by improved functional capability seen as an increase in grip strength L6778 In clinical trials indometacin was shown to be effective in relieving the pain reducing the fever swelling redness and tenderness of acute gouty arthritis Due to its pharmacological actions the use of indometacin is associated with the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events including myocardial infarction and stroke as well as gastrointestinal effects such as bleeding ulceration and perforation of the stomach or intestines L6778 In a study of healthy individuals acute oral and intravenous indometacin therapy resulted in a transiently diminished basal and CO2 stimulated cerebral blood flow this effect disappeared in one study after one week of oral treatment L6778 The clinical significance of this effect has not been established Compared to other NSAIDs it is suggested that indometacin is a more potent vasoconstrictor that is more consistent in decreasing cerebral blood flow and inhibiting CO2 reactivity A177871 There have been studies that show indometacin directly inhibiting neuronal activity to some extent in the trigeminocervical complex after either superior salivatory nucleus or dural stimulation A177871",
