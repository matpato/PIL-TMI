                "pharmacodynamics": "Use of the first generation antipsychotics including haloperidol is considered highly effective for the management of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations hearing voices aggression hostility disorganized speech and psychomotor agitation However this class is limited by the development of movement disorders such as drug induced parkinsonism akathisia dystonia and tardive dyskinesia and other side effects including sedation weight gain and prolactin changes Compared to the lower potency first generation antipsychotics such as DB00477 DB01624 DB00623 and DB01403 haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within class but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms EPS A180613 A180616 A180625 Low potency medications have a lower affinity for dopamine receptors so that a higher dose is required to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia In addition they block many receptors other than the primary target dopamine receptors such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation weight gain and hypotension The balance between the wanted drug effects on psychotic symptoms and unwanted side effects are largely at play within dopaminergic brain pathways affected by haloperidol Cortical dopamine D2 pathways play an important role in regulating these effects and include the nigrostriatal pathway which is responsible for causing extrapyramidal symptoms EPS the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways which are responsible for the improvement in positive schizophrenic symptoms and the tuberoinfundibular dopamine pathway which is responsible for hyperprolactinemia A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible involuntary dyskinetic movements may develop in patients Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly especially elderly women it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict at the inception of antipsychotic treatment which patients are likely to develop the syndrome F4645 Cases of sudden death QT prolongation and Torsades de Pointes have been reported in patients receiving haloperidol Higher than recommended doses of any formulation and intravenous administration of haloperidol appear to be associated with a higher risk of QT prolongation and Torsades de Pointes Although cases have been reported even in the absence of predisposing factors particular caution is advised in treating patients with other QT prolonging conditions including electrolyte imbalance particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia drugs known to prolong QT underlying cardiac abnormalities hypothyroidism and familial long QT syndrome F4645 A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome NMS has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia muscle rigidity altered mental status including catatonic signs and evidence of autonomic instability irregular pulse or blood pressure tachycardia diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmias Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase myoglobinuria rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure F4645",
