            "therapeutic_indications": "Patisirant is indicated for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin mediated amyloidosis in adults FDA Label It is administered with pre medication to reduce complications FDA Label These include an intravenous corticosteroid equivalent to 10 mg of dexamethasone 500 mg of oral acetaminophen an intravenous histamine H1 blocker equivalent to 50 mg of diphenhydramine and an intravenous histamine H2 blocker equivalent to 50 mg of ranitidine",

                "disease": "Patisiran produced no signs of embryo fetal toxicity at dosages of up to 1 5 mg kg in rats FDA Label In rabbits given dosages of 0 0 3 1 and 2 mg kg embryo fetal and maternal toxicity were seen at mid and high dosages No data exists in human subjects regarding risk during pregnancy Patisirant does not appear to be present in breast milk however the lipid components of the liposomal dosage form are present FDA Label Patisirant is immunogenic with specific antibodies appearing in 3 6 of treated patients FDA Label While there is no evidence of these antibodies reducing the efficacy of the drug there is a risk of experiencing immunologic complications associated with the use of biologics Patisirant is known to reduce available vitamin A Patients using the drug are at increased risk of vitamin A deficiency FDA Label",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Transthyretin normally plays a role in the transport of vitamin A in conjunction with retinol binding protein A36929 Mutant transthyretin of the ATTR genotype is capable of forming amyloid fibrils and creating protein deposits in a condition known as transthyretin mediated amyloidosis Patisiran reduces the amount of wild type and mutant transthyretin mRNA available for translation through RNA interference A36930 A36927 FDA Label This has the effect of decreasing circulating transthyretin protein and reducing the amyloid deposits associated with transthyretin mediated amyloidosis",
