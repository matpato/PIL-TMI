                "pharmacodynamics": "In animal models AC 100 promoted cartilage regeneration In the study goats with an osteochondral femoral condylar knee cartilage defect were used to evaluate the effects of AC 100 on cartilage regeneration Cylindrical defects were created in the knee cartilage and were filled with a collagen sponge containing AC 100 at two different doses or a collagen sponge soaked in saline control group Post operative treatments included intra articular injections of the test articles into the operated knee joint at weeks one two and three post surgery Cartilage regeneration was evaluated in one group after 84 days and 168 days in another group The results demonstrated that the application of AC 100 dose dependently promoted cartilage defect repair The groups treated with the higher dosage of AC 100 had greater healing outcome scores than the saline control groups As there was no evidence of an inflammatory response AC 100 demonstrated a favorable safety profile in the study",
