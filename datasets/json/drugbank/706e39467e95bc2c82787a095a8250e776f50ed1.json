                "pharmacodynamics": "Pantothenic acid is a precursor of coenzyme A which serves as a cofactor for a variety of enzyme catalyzed reactions involving transfer of acetyl groups The final step in the synthesis of acetylcholine consists of the choline acetylase transfer of acetyl group from acetylcoenzyme A to choline Acetylcholine is the neurohumoral transmitter in the parasympathetic system and as such maintains the normal functions of the intestine Decrease in acetylcholine content would result in decreased peristalsis and in extreme cases adynamic ileus",
