            "therapeutic_indications": "For diagnostic use only Indicated for adults and children age 2 and over for contrast enhancement during cranial and spinal MRI and for contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography CE MRA Gadobutrol is particularly suited for the detection of very small lesions and for the visualization of tumors that do not readily take up contrast media It may be a desired agent when the exclusion or demonstration of an additional pathology may influence the choice of therapy or patient management It may also be suitable for perfusion studies in the diagnosis of stroke detection of focal cerebral ischemia and in studies of tumor perfusion",

                "disease": "Lethality was observed in rodents after a single intravenous administration of 20 mmol kg This represents a dose of at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than the standard single diagnostic dose in humans 0 1 mmol kg No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted No mutagenesis was observed in vitro in reverse mutation tests in bacteria or in the HGPRT hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase test using Chinese hamster V79 cells Similarly no mutagenesis was seen in chromosome abberation tests of human peripheral blood lymphocytes It was also negative in in vivo micronucleus tests in mice following a 0 5mmol kg intravenous injection No fertility or reproductive impairment was observed in male and female rates given doses 12 2 times human equivalent doses based on body surface area Intolerance reactions local to the injection site have been observed in rabbits after paravenous administration and are associated with the infiltration of inflammatory cells suggesting the possibility of local irritation if the contrast medium leaks around veins in a clinical setting",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Even at low concentrations Gadobutrol can lead to distinct shortening of relaxation times of protons in plasma At physiological conditions pH 7 temperature 37 C and 1 5T the relaxivity r1 is 5 2L mmol sec based on the relaxation times T1 while the relativity r2 is 6 1L mmol sec based on relaxation times T2 Magnetic field strength has only slight influence on relaxivities Drug concentration and r1 relaxivity may contribute to a T1 shortening effect which may improve tissue visualization",
