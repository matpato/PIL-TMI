                "disease": "Netilmicin has nephrotoxic and ototoxic potential Nephrotoxicity occurs via drug accumulation in renal proximal tubular cells resulting in cellular damage Tubular cells may regenerate despite continued exposure and nephrotoxicity is usually mild and reversible Netilmicin is less nephrotoxic than neomycin gentamicin tobramycin and amikacin likely due to a reduced number of cationic amino groups in its structure Otoxicity occurs as a result of irreversible damage to hair cells of the cochlea and or summit of the ampullar cristae in the vestibular complex caused drug accumulation in the endolymph and perilymph of the inner ear Otoxicity appears to be correlated to total exposure and may be cumulative with further doses of aminoglycosides or other ototoxic drugs e g cisplatin furosemide High frequency hearing loss is followed by low frequency hearing loss which may be followed by retrograde degeneration of the auditory nerve Vestibular toxicity may cause vertigo nausea and vomiting dizziness and loss of balance",
