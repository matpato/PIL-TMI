            "therapeutic_indications": "Prior to its withdrawal aminopterin was initially used in the treatment of childhood leukemia specifically to induce remissions Later aminopterin was used off label in the United States to treat psoriasis yielding dramatic lesion clearing Aminopterin was later supplanted by methotrexate for treating cancer because of its better therapeutic index Aminopterin as well as methotrexate has also been explored for use as an abortifacient However their association with severe congenital malformations and teratogenic effects have become known as fetal aminopterin syndrome",
