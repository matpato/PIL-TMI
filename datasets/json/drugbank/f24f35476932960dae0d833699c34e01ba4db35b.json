                "pharmacodynamics": "Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms Non proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine Upon uptake into cells azacitidine is phosphorylated to 5 azacytidine monophosphate by uridine cytidine kinase then to diphosphate by pyrimidine monophosphate kinases and triphosphate by diphosphate kinases 5 Azacitidine triphosphate is incorporated into RNA leading to the disruption of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA metabolism and inhibition of protein synthesis 5 Azacytidine diphosphate is reduced to 5 aza deoxycytidine diphosphate by ribonucleotide reductase The resultant metabolite is phosphorylated to 5 azadeoxycitidine triphosphate by nucleoside diphosphate kinases 5 azadeoxycitidine triphosphate is then incoporated into DNA leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis Azacitidine is most toxic during the S phase of the cell cycle",
