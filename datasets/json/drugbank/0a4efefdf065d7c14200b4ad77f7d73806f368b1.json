            "therapeutic_indications": "Used in the treatment of symptomatic Paget s disease for patients unresponsive to alternate treatments or intolerant to such treatments In addition it is used in emergency situations when serum calcium levels must be decreased quickly until the underlying condition is identified It can also be added to existing therapeutic regimens for hypercalcemia such as intravenous fluids and furosemide oral phosphate or corticosteroids or other agents Calcitonin can be used in patients with azotemia and cases where intravenous fluids would be contraindicated due to limited cardiac reserves Also for the treatment of post menopausal osteoporosis in women more than 5 years post menopause",

                "disease": "Salmon calcitonin was shown to inhibit lactation in animals and is not recommend in nursing mothers While research in animals have shown a decrease in fetal weight no studies have yet shown similar results in humans It is recommended however to proceed carefully when administering salmon calcitonin to pregnant women and consider if the benefits outweigh the risks Because of its protein nature salmon calcitonin may provoke an allergy reaction bronchospams and swelling of the tongue throat that can turn into a full blown anaphylactic response The manufacturer also reports an increase in the risk of malignancies from oral route 0 7 to intranasal route 2 4 compared to placebo The same may apply to IV IM and SC routes since the systemic exposure is higher in those cases Nausea is noticeable in some patients but tends to decrease with continued administration Rhinitis headaches and back pain have also been reported among others",
