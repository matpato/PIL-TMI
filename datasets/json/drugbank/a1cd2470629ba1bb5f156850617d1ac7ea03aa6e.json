                "pharmacodynamics": "Altropane is a molecular imaging agent that specifically binds to the dopamine transporter DAT protein found on the surface of dopamine producing neurons making it visible during SPECT imaging Since most forms of Parkinsonian Syndromes result in a decreased number of dopamine producing cells it would be expected that these patients also have fewer DATs than do patients without PS Thus it is believed that altropane used in conjunction with SPECT imaging could be a useful test to distinguish Parkinsonian Syndrome tremors from non Parkinsonian tremor non Parkinsonian patients would have more altropane binding visible in the SPECT image while Parkinsonian patients would have less",
