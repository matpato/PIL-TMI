            "therapeutic_indications": "Polysilicone 15 is used as an UV filter in cosmetic sunscreen products as well as in other cosmetic products like shampoos conditioners hairsprays etc where it can confer photostability to the product s L2799 F89",

                "disease": "From what studies are available the overall belief at the moment is that polysilicone 15 largely remains on the surface of the skin when applied and that skin penetration tests demonstrated maximum retention on the skin L2796 F88 The systemic presence of the compound is consequently expected to be minimal",

                "pharmacodynamics": "As an active ingredient in sunscreen products polysilicone 15 is applied directly onto human skin where it acts as a chemical sunscreen layer between skin and sunlight that also directly absorbs the UV sunlight radiation L2796 L2797 L2799 F87 F88 F89 When used in combination with other ingredients in cosmetic shampoos conditioners hairsprays etc the photostable polysilicone 15 confers photostability onto the entire combined product protecting it from deterioration in the sunlight by absorbing the UV light radiation L2799 F89 Additionally there have been studies suggesting polysilicone 15 is also considered to have little to no absorption through the skin L2796 so little systemic exposure and pharmacokinetics are expected and users can freely wash off and re apply the compound as necessary",
