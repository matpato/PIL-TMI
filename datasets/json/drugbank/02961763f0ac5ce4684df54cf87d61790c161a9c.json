            "therapeutic_indications": "Viltolarsen is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in patients confirmed to have a _DMD_ gene mutation amenable to exon 53 skipping This indication represents an accelerated approval based on observed efficacy continued approval for this indication may be contingent on the verification of safety and efficacy in a confirmatory trial L15526",

                "disease": "Viltolarsen administered by subcutaneous injection in juvenile male mice resulted in deaths due to renal toxicity at high doses in animals administered either 240 or 1200 mg kg viltolarsen dose dependent increases in the incidence and severity of renal tubular effects were observed Although renal toxicity in humans has not been observed it is recommended to measure urine dipstick every month and serum cystatin C and urine protein to creatinine ratio every three months to detect renal toxicity L15526",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Viltolarsen is an antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide designed to bind to and disrupt splicing of exon 53 in the human _DMD_ gene which results in the expression of a partially functional dystrophin protein in patients who otherwise would not produce dystrophin A218161 A218166 L15526 Despite a relatively short half life the physiological effect of producing relatively stable dystrophin protein allows for effective therapeutic benefit with weekly dosing L15526 Viltolarsen may cause renal toxicity and so kidney function should be monitored in patients However due to the alteration of serum creatinine in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients A218171 creatinine should not be used as a marker of renal function L15526",
