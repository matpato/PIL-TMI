                "pharmacodynamics": "Povidone iodine is a kind of iodine disinfectant which directly cause in vivo protein denaturation precipitation of bacteria and further resulting in the death of pathogenic microorganisms Therefore it is effective in disinfection and sterilization It can kill viruses bacteria spores fungi and protozoa with low toxicity to human Povidone iodine aqueous solution has strong pharmacological activity against Staphylococcus aureus Neisseria gonorrhoeae Pseudomonas aeruginosa syphilis hepatitis B virus HIV and Trichomonas vaginalis Povidone iodine gel is a gynecological topical semi mobile colloidal agent made by povidone iodine and hydrophilic matrix It is a system for maintaining its sustained release Owing to the continuous release of free iodine it can enable the skin and mucous membranes to maintain a certain effective concentration of iodine for killing bacteria It is mainly used for gynecological vaginal infection It exerted its effect through being miscible with vaginal secretions and further killing the inside pathogenic microorganisms and thus blocking the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and invasion as well as treating other infected vaginal diseases caused by other kinds of bacteria Published reports on the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of iodophors demonstrate that iodophors are bactericidal mycobactericidal and virucidal but can require prolonged contact times to kill certain fungi and bacterial spores Three brands of povidone iodine solution have demonstrated more rapid kill seconds to minutes of S aureus and M chelonae at a 1 100 dilution than did the stock solution The virucidal activity of 75 150 ppm available iodine was demonstrated against seven viruses Other investigators have questioned the efficacy of iodophors against poliovirus in the presence of organic matter and rotavirus in distilled or tapwater Manufacturers data demonstrate that commercial iodophors are not sporicidal but they are tuberculocidal fungicidal virucidal and bactericidal at their recommended use dilution",
