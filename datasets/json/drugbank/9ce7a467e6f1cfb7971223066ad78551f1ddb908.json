                "pharmacodynamics": "Primaquine is an antimalarial agent and is the essential co drug with chloroquine in treating all cases of malaria In the blood malaria parasites break down a part of the red blood cells known as haemoglobin When this happens haemoglobin is divided into two parts haem and globin Haem is toxic to the malaria parasite To prevent it from being damaged the malaria parasite produces an chemical which converts the toxic haem into a non toxic product Primaquine acts by interfering with a part of the parasite mitochondria that is responsible for supplying it with energy Without energy the parasite dies This stops the infection from continuing and allows the person to recover Primaquine kills the intrahepatic form of i Plasmodium vivax i and i Plasmodium ovale i and thereby prevents the development of the erythrocytic forms that are responsible for relapses it also kills gametocytes Primaquine is not used in the prevention of malaria only in the treatment It has insignificant activity against the asexual blood forms of the parasite and therefore it is always used in conjunction with a blood schizonticide and never as a single agent Primaquine has gametocytocidal activity against all plasmodia including i P falciparum i",
