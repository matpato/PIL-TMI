            "therapeutic_indications": "Fluocinolone acetonide has been used extensively in different medical areas In dermatology it is extensively used for the relief of inflammatory dermatosis dermatitis psoriasis hypertrophic tissues keloid tissues and atopic dermatitis F1955 It has been used in shampoo products as a low to medium potency corticosteroid for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp L4682 In ear drops it is used as a low to medium potency corticosteroid for the treatment of chronic eczematous external otitis in adults and pediatric patients 2 years and older L4683 As an intravitreal implant it is indicated for the treatment of diabetic macular edema with patients that have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and no clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure L4684 Fluocinolone acetonide was announced on October 15 2018 to be FDA approved for the treatment of chronic non infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye L4685 Some reports have indicated the use of fluocinolone acetonide as a vasoprotective agent and for its use in the treatment of first degree hemorrhoids A39532",
