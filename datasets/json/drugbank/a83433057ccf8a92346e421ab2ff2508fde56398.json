                "pharmacodynamics": "XL765 is an orally available small molecule that has been shown in preclinical studies to selectively inhibit the activity of phosphoinositide 3 kinase PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR Activation of PI3K is a frequent event in human tumors promoting tumor cell growth survival and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy mTOR is also frequently activated in human tumors and plays a central role in tumor cell growth mTOR can be activated via upregulation of PI3K or via PI3K independent mechanisms Inactivation of PI3K has been shown to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis programmed cell death in tumor cells whereas inactivation of mTOR has been shown to inhibit the growth of tumor cells In preclinical studies XL765 slowed tumor growth or caused tumor shrinkage in multiple preclinical cancer models including breast lung ovarian and prostate cancers and gliomas XL765 has also been shown to enhance the anti tumor effects of several chemotherapeutic agents in preclinical cancer models XL765 has at least a 24 hour duration of action against both PI3K and mTOR readouts in tumors in vivo following a single oral PO dose of 30 100 mg kg",
