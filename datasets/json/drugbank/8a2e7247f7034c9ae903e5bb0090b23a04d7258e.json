            "therapeutic_indications": "Eteplirsen is indicated for treatment of certain individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy DMD Its use is limited to those with a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene which would benefit from exon 51 skipping Based on clinical studies showing increased dystrophin production in skeletal muscle in some patients given this drug the above indication was approved under accelerated approval Further confirmatory trials are required to demonstrate clinical benefit of eteplirsen",

                "disease": "Potential adverse effects of eteplirsen were determined in 2 studies 1 A 24 week double blind placebo controlled study 2 An open label extension following the first study In study 1 the following adverse effects occurred more frequently in 2 or more patients receiving eteplirsen compared to placebo Balance disorder 38 vomiting 38 contact dermatitis 25 These percentages represent crude frequencies due to the small sample of patients studied therefore they may not be representative of the general population All patients in study 1 continued to participate in study 2 The following adverse effects occurred at a rate 10 among the 88 patients receiving 30 mg kg week of eteplirsen for up to 208 weeks in study 2 vomiting contusion excoriation arthralgia rash pain at catheter site and upper respiratory tract infections These adverse events also occurred more frequently in patients in study 2 compared to patients in study 1 on the same dose of eteplirsen Facial flushing transient erythema and elevated temperature have been reported to occur on the days of eteplirsen infusion",

                "pharmacodynamics": "The defining characteristic of DMD is lack of dystrophin which is a protein that plays a vital role in maintaining muscle cell membrane integrity 2 This is caused by a mutation in the DMD gene which leads to disruption of the translational reading frame and ultimately in a non functional protein 2 Eteplirsen is a targeted oligonucleotide that causes exon skipping of exon 51 and restores the translational reading frame 2 The expected result is production of an internally deleted but functional dystrophin protein 2 Three clinical studies were done to evaluate eteplirsen All patients in studies had a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene susceptible to exon 51 skipping All patients treated with the drug produced messenger ribonucleic acid mRNA coding for an internally truncated dystrophin protein In study 3 after 48 weeks of treatment with eteplirsen the average dystrophin protein level was 0 44 of normal what would be found in a healthy subject compared to 0 16 of normal prior to treatment There was a median increase of 0 1 in truncated dystrophin",
