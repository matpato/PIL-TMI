                "pharmacodynamics": "Gonadorelin is responsible for the release of follicle stimulating hormone and leutinizing hormone from the anterior pitutitary In the pituitary GnRH stimulates synthesis and release of FSH and LH a process that is controlled by the frequency and amplitude of GnRH pulses as well as the feedback of androgens and estrogens The pulsatility of GnRH secretion has been seen in all vertebrates and it is necessary to ensure a correct reproductive function Thus a single hormone GnRH controls a complex process of follicular growth ovulation and corpus luteum maintenance in the female and spermatogenesis in the male Its short half life requires infusion pumps for its clinical use",
