                "pharmacodynamics": "Bromodiphenhydramine is an antihistamine of the ethanolamine class Ethanolamine antihistamines have significant antimuscarinic activity and produce marked sedation in most patients In addition to the usual allergic symptoms the drug also treats irritant cough and nausea vomiting and vertigo associated with motion sickness It also is used commonly to treat drug induced extrapyramidal symptoms as well as to treat mild cases of Parkinson s disease Rather than preventing the release of histamine as do cromolyn and nedocromil Bromodiphenhydramine competes with free histamine for binding at HA receptor sites Bromodiphenhydramine competitively antagonizes the effects of histamine on HA receptors in the GI tract uterus large blood vessels and bronchial muscle Ethanolamine derivatives have greater anticholinergic activity than do other antihistamines which probably accounts for the antidyskinetic action of Bromodiphenhydramine This anticholinergic action appears to be due to a central antimuscarinic effect which also may be responsible for its antiemetic effects although the exact mechanism is unknown",
