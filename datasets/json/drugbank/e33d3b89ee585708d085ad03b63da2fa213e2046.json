            "therapeutic_indications": "The drug is used to reduce the risk of life threatening infection in patients with neutropenia particularly after cytotoxic chemotherapy Lenograstim is indicated as a treatment to reduce the duration of neutropenia and the severity of infections in patients with non myeloid malignancy who have undergone autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or treatment with established cytotoxic chemotherapy and in addition to reduce the incidence of infection associated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy Lenograstim is also indicated to mobilise peripheral blood progenitor cells PBPCs with Lenograstim alone or after myelosuppressive chemotherapy in order to accelerate haematopoietic recovery by infusion of such cells after myelosuppressive or myeloablative therapy Lenograstim is also indicated to accelerate the engraftment of these cells after their reinfusion GRANOCYTE is also indicated for the treatment of severe chronic neutropenia including congenital agranulocytosis Kostmann s syndrome",
