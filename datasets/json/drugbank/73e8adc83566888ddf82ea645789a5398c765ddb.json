                "pharmacodynamics": "Creatine is a essential non proteinaceous amino acid derivative found in all animals It is synthesized in the kidney liver and pancreas from L arginine glycine and L methionine Following its biosynthesis creatine is transported to the skeletal muscle heart brain and other tissues Most of the creatine is metabolized in these tissues to phosphocreatine creatine phosphate Phosphocreatine is a major energy storage form in the body Supplemental creatine may have an energy generating action during anaerobic exercise and may also have neuroprotective and cardioprotective actions",
