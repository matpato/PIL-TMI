                "pharmacodynamics": "Dipivefrin is a member of a class of drugs known as prodrugs Prodrugs are usually not active in themselves and require biotransformation to the parent compound before therapeutic activity is seen These modifications are undertaken to enhance absorption decrease side effects and enhance stability and comfort thus making the parent compound a more useful drug Enhanced absorption makes the prodrug a more efficient delivery system for the parent drug because less drug will be needed to produce the desired therapeutic response Dipivefrin is a prodrug of epinephrine formed by the diesterification of epinephrine and pivalic acid The addition of pivaloyl groups to the epinephrine molecule enhances its lipophilic character and as a consequence its penetration into the anterior chamber",
