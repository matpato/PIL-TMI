                "pharmacodynamics": "Anethol trithione ATT possesses a high lipophilicity log P 3 8 but an extremely low water solubility 0 38 ug mL which limits its dissolution and absorption A32614 A32616 Furthermore ATT is quickly metabolized into 4 hydroxy anethole trithione ATX which demonstrates a similar pharmacological activity to ATT by way of O demethylation A32614 A32616 As a consequence the plasma concentration of ATT is usually fairly low resulting in a limited oral bioavailability as well A32614 A32616 Given this pharmacodynamic profile there is continued interest and study in developing vehicles with which ATT can be administered in larger availabilities into the body A32614 A32616",
