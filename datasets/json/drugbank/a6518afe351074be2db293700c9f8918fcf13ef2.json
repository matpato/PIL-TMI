            "therapeutic_indications": "Rifamycin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with travelers diarrhea caused by noninvasive strains of _E coli_ The status of the disease should not be complicated by fever or blood in the stool To prevent drug resistant bacteria it is important to mention that the use of rifamycin for this indication should be only done in cases where the infection is proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria L4802 Travallers diarrhea is very common problem affecting 20 60 of the travellers and it is defined as an increase in frequency of bowel movements to three or more loose stools per day during a trip abroad This condition is rarely life threatening but in severe cases it can produce dehydration and sepsis The most common cause of travellers diarrhea is a pathogen and from the pathogens identified bacteria is the most common cause followed by norovirus rotavirus and similar viruses A39995",
