            "therapeutic_indications": "Magnesium gluconate is a mineral supplement which is used to prevent and treat low levels of magnesium Magnesium is very important for the normal physiologic functioning of cells nerves muscles bones and the heart Generally a well balanced diet provides the necessary amounts of magnesium for homeostasis However certain conditions causing chronic magnesium deficiency may decrease levels of magnesium These conditions include treatment with diuretics a poor diet alcoholism or other medical conditions e g severe diarrhea vomiting stomach intestinal absorption problems poorly controlled diabetes L2600",

                "disease": "Oral LD50 is 9100 mg kg in the rat F19 Excess magnesium from dietary sources does not pose a health risk in healthy individuals because the kidneys eliminate excess amounts of magnesium in the urine On the other hand high doses of magnesium from dietary supplements or medications often result in diarrhea that can be combined with nausea and abdominal cramping Forms of magnesium most commonly reported to cause diarrhea include magnesium carbonate chloride gluconate and oxide Diarrheal and laxative effects of magnesium salts are due to the osmotic activity of unabsorbed salts in the intestine and colon and the stimulation of gastric motility L2606 Hypermagnesaemia after oral ingestion is uncommon except in patients with renal impairment Signs and symptoms of hypermagnesemia may include respiratory depression loss of deep tendon reflexes due to neuromuscular blockade nausea vomiting flushing hypotension drowsiness bradycardia and muscle weakness Very high doses of magnesium containing laxatives and antacids normally providing more than 5 000 mg day magnesium have been associated with the occurrence of magnesium toxicity including fatal hypermagnesemia in a 28 month old boy as well as an elderly man Symptoms of magnesium toxicity normally presenting at concentrations of 1 74 2 61 mmol L may include hypotension nausea vomiting facial flushing retention of urine ileus depression and lethargy before progressing to muscle weakness difficulty breathing extreme hypotension irregular heartbeat and cardiac arrest The risk of magnesium toxicity increases with compromised renal function or kidney failure because the ability to remove excess magnesium is reduced or lost L2601 Treatment In patients with normal renal function IV fluids or furosemide may be administered to promote the excretion of magnesium In patients with symptomatic hypermagnesaemia slow IV injection of calcium gluconate can be administered to antagonize the cardiac and neuromuscular effects of magnesium L2606",
