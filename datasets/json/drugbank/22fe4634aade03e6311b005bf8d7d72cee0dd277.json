                "pharmacodynamics": "Ramipril is an ACE inhibitor similar to benazepril fosinopril and quinapril T116 It is an inactive prodrug that is converted to ramiprilat in the liver the main site of activation and kidneys Ramiprilat confers blood pressure lowing effects by antagonizing the effect of the RAAS The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics water and electrolyte balance During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys In the blood stream renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms First it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule DCT and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium potassium ATPases on cell membranes Second ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH from the posterior pituitary gland ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin 2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules Third ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction In addition to these major effects ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS induced increases in blood pressure ACE also known as kininase II is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin a vasodilator Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain the effects of ramiprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure",
