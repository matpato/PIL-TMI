                "pharmacodynamics": "Following intravenous administration of Cholografin Meglumine iodipamide is carried to the liver where it is rapidly secreted The contrast medium appears in the bile within 10 to 15 minutes after injection thus permitting visualization of the hepatic and common bile ducts even in cholecystectomized patients The biliary ducts are readily visualized within about 25 minutes after administration except in patients with impaired liver function The gallbladder begins to fill within an hour after injection maximum filling is reached after two to two and one half hours The contrast medium is finally eliminated in the feces without passing through the enterohepatic circulation except for approximately 10 percent of the intravenously administered dose which is excreted through the kidneys",
