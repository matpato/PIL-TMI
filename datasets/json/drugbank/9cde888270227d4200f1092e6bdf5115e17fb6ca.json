                "pharmacodynamics": "Loteprednol etabonate LE belongs to a unique class of corticosteroids with potent anti inflammatory effects designed to be active at the site of action A1312 L4539 Animal studies have shown that LE has a binding affinity to steroid receptors that is 4 3 times greater than dexamethasone L4539 This particular class of steroids consists of bioactive molecules whose in vivo transformation to non toxic substances can be predicted from their chemistry and knowledge of enzymatic pathways in the body L4539 Cortienic acid is an inactive metabolite of hydrocortisone and analogs of cortienic acid are also devoid of corticosteroid activity L4539 Specifically LE is an ester derivative of one of these analogs cortienic acid etabonate L4539 In particular LE possesses a metabolically labile 17 beta chloromethyl ester function which was designed in order to be hydrolyzed to an inactive carboxylic acid moiety A1312 This inactive metabolite is more hydrophilic and is thus readily eliminated from the body A1312 LE also exhibits good ocular permeation properties and good skin permeation properties A1312",
