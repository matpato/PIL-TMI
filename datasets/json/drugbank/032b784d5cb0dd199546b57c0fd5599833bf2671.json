                "pharmacodynamics": "Patients with advanced renal insufficiency creatinine clearance less than 30 ml min exhibit phosphate retention and some degree of hyperphosphatemia The retention of phosphate plays a pivotal role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with osteodystrophy and soft tissue calcification The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is not clearly delineated Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient Dialysis patients absorb 40 to 80 of dietary phosphorus Therefore the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces Maintenance of serum phosphorus below 6 0 mg dl is generally considered as a clinically acceptable outcome of treatment with phosphate binders Calcium acetate is highly soluble at neutral pH making the calcium readily available for binding to phosphate in the proximal small intestine",
