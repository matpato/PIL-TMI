                "pharmacodynamics": "Following intravenous injection ammonia N 13 enters the myocardium through the coronary arteries The PET technique measures myocardial blood flow based on the assumption of a three compartmental disposition of intravenous ammonia N 13 in the myocardium In this model the value of the rate constant which represents the delivery of blood to myocardium and the fraction of ammonia N 13 extracted into the myocardial cells is a measure of myocardial blood flow Optimal PET imaging of the myocardium is generally achieved between 10 to 20 minutes after administration",
