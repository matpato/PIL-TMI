                "disease": "Many of gestrinone s adverse effects occur due to its androgenic activity These effects include acne seborrhea hirsutism weight gain and deepening of the voice Most patients develop at least one adverse event while taking this drug This is because the drug is embryotoxic in some animals and may also cause masculinization of a female fetus Gestrinone significantly reduces HDL concentrations L1697 It is advisable to monitor liver transaminases and cholesterol levels in hyperlipidemic patients as well as glucose in diabetic patients Gestrinone has shown to decrease in the concentration of thyroid binding globulin Therefore a decrease in serum total thyroxine levels is commonly observed This is without clinical significance as free thyroxine levels and thyroid stimulating hormone levels remain within the normal reference range L1700",
