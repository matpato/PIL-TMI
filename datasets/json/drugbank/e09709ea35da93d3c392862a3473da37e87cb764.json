            "therapeutic_indications": "By the WHO moxisylyte is indicated for the symptomatic management of sequelae of cerebral infarction or hemorrhage T91 The cerebral infarction is characterized by the blockage of the artery either by the formation of a thrombus or an embolus A31644 On the other hand the FDA classified moxisylyte for the reversal of phenylephrine induced mydriasis in patients who have narrow anterior angles and are at risk of developing an acute attack of angle closure glaucoma L1172 Closed angle glaucoma is caused by the contact between the iris and the trabecular meshwork This contact will damage the aqueous outflow by the meshwork thus increasing eye pressure and producing the symptoms of glaucoma A31645 Mydriasis is referred to the dilatation of the pupils and this standard body function is known to be a trigger factor for the development of acute closed angle glaucoma This risk is explained by the generation of a pupillary block which is the contact between the pupillary margins and the lens thus preventing flow from the aqueous humor to the anterior chamber and followed by an increased pressure gradient L1173 Moxisylyte is also approved in France as the first drug for the treatment of impotence A31647",
