                "pharmacodynamics": "Asparagine is ordinarily found incorporated into most endogenous proteins L1447 In its absence however protein synthesis is halted which in turn also results in the inhibition of the RNA and DNA synthesis necessary for cellular proliferation L1447 One commonality between Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia ALL Acute Myeloid Leukaemia AML and Non Hodgkin s Lymphoma especially the lymphoblastic form is the absence of asparagine synthetase activity in the neoplastic cells associated with these conditions L1447 These neoplastic cells are subsequently dependent upon exogenous asparagine for their proliferation L1447 The anti neoplastic function of L asparaginase is consequently a result of the sustained depletion of exogenous asparagine L1447 In particular _Erwinia_ L asparaginase catalyses the deamination of asparagine to aspartic acid and the release of an ammonia molecule L1447 In addition asparaginase also demonstrates a significant glutaminase activity in which it is capable of catalyzing the deamination of glutamine to glutamate and the release of an ammonia molecule L1447 Since glutamine may lead to alternative asparagine synthesis the ability for asparaginase to facilitate glutamine depletion may complement asparagine depletion L1447 The exact potential to such glutaminase activity however remains unknown L1447",
