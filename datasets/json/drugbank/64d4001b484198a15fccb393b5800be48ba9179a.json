                "pharmacodynamics": "Bromocriptine stimulates centrally located dopaminergic receptors resulting in a number of pharmacologic effects Five dopamine receptor types from two dopaminergic subfamilies have been identified The dopaminergic D1 receptor subfamily consists of D sub 1 sub and D sub 5 sub subreceptors which are associated with dyskinesias The dopaminergic D2 receptor subfamily consists of D sub 2 sub D sub 3 sub and D sub 4 sub subreceptors which are associated with improvement of symptoms of movement disorders Thus agonist activity specific for D2 subfamily receptors primarily D sub 2 sub and D sub 3 sub receptor subtypes are the primary targets of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents It is thought that postsynaptic D sub 2 sub stimulation is primarily responsible for the antiparkinsonian effect of dopamine agonists while presynaptic D sub 2 sub stimulation confers neuroprotective effects This semisynthetic ergot derivative exhibits potent agonist activity on dopamine D sub 2 sub receptors It also exhibits agonist activity in order of decreasing binding affinity on 5 hydroxytryptamine 5 HT sub 1D sub dopamine D sub 3 sub 5 HT sub 1A sub 5 HT sub 2A sub 5 HT sub 1B sub and 5 HT sub 2C sub receptors antagonist activity on alpha sub 2A sub adrenergic alpha sub 2C sub alpha sub 2B sub and dopamine D sub 1 sub receptors partial agonist activity at receptor 5 HT sub 2B sub and inactivates dopamine D sub 4 sub and 5 HT sub 7 sub receptors Parkinsonian Syndrome manifests when approximately 80 of dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain is lost As this striatum is involved in modulating the intensity of coordinated muscle activity e g movement balance walking loss of activity may result in dystonia acute muscle contraction Parkinsonism including symptoms of bradykinesia tremor rigidity and flattened affect akathesia inner restlessness tardive dyskinesia involuntary muscle movements usually associated with long term loss of dopaminergic activity and neuroleptic malignant syndrome which manifests when complete blockage of nigrostriatal dopamine occurs High dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain causes hallucinations and delusions these side effects of dopamine agonists are manifestations seen in patients with schizophrenia who have overractivity in this area of the brain The hallucinogenic side effects of dopamine agonists may also be due to 5 HT sub 2A sub agonism The tuberoinfundibular pathway of the brain originates in the hypothalamus and terminates in the pituitary gland In this pathway dopamine inhibits lactotrophs in anterior pituitary from secreting prolactin Increased dopaminergic activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway inhibits prolactin secretion making bromocriptine an effective agent for treating disorders associated with hypersecretion of prolactin Pulmonary fibrosis may be associated bromocriptine s agonist activity at 5 HT sub 1B sub and 5 HT sub 2B sub receptors",
