            "therapeutic_indications": "There are limited therapeutic uses for which galactose is formally indicated Some predominant indications include a the use of galactose to facilitate the construction of structurally and immunologically effective attenuated vaccines T188 L2633 and b the role galactose plays as an essential element in the formation of lactulose a synthetic disaccharide indicated for the treatment of constipation and or hepatic encephalopathy HE hepatic coma L2632 Nevertheless there are many studies looking into a variety of possible uses for galactose including the use of the monosaccharide sugar for accelerating senescence in mice rats and Drosophila A32853 A32854 the proposed association between galactose in consumed milk and ovarian cancer A32855 A32856 a possible role in the therapy of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis A32858 among various others Regardless none of these proposed indications have yet been formally elucidated for practical use",

                "disease": "It is typically uncommon to experience an overdosage situation with dietary galactose or from galactose as an ingredient in a therapeutic agent At the same time the experiencing a situation characterized by excessive amounts of galactose in the body defines the challenge with galactosemia which is itself a rare genetic metabolic disorder In individuals with galactosemia the enzymes needed for further metabolism of galactose ie such as galactose 1 phosphate uridyltransferase are severely diminished or missing entirely leading to toxic levels of galactose 1 phosphate in various tissues A32875 This toxic excess typically results in hepatomegaly cirrhosis renal failure cataracts vomiting hypoglycemia lethargy brain damage and ovarian failure A32875 Without treatment mortality in infants with galactosemia is about 75 A32876",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Galactose is a naturally occurring monosaccharide that forms the disaccharide lactose when combined with glucose another monosaccharide A32864 Subsequently when lactose or small amounts of free galactose found in various common dairy products and other foods are consumed the hydrolysis of lactose to glucose and galactose occurs and galactose is itself further metabolized to generate glucose A32864 Such glucose is of course ultimately relied upon and used as the primary metabolic fuel for humans in a variety of biological reactions Conversely however the ways in which galactose is commonly used in therapeutic agents generally do not rely upon such pharmacodynamics even though they ultimately remain the most important ways in which galactose exerts or elicits useful biological actions for the human body",
