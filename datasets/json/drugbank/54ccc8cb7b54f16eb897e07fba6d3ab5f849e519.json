                "disease": "Ketamine hydrochloride LD50 447 mg kg Rat oral MSDS Neurotoxicity In a one dose neuronal toxicity study with esketamine intranasal administration to adult female rats no finding of neuronal vacuolation in the brain occurred with doses up to the equivalent of the maximum recommended human dose of 84 mg day In a second single dose neurotoxicity study performed with intranasal esketamine administration in adult female rats no observation of neuronal necrosis up to a dose equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose was made Neuronal vacuolation was not evaluated in this study FDA label The relevance of these findings in humans is unknown at this time FDA label A note on dependence and tolerance Reports of physical dependence have been made following prolonged use of ketamine Withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or significant dosage reduction of a drug is a common manifestation of drug dependence There were no withdrawal symptoms observed up to 4 weeks in subjects after stopping esketamine treatment Withdrawal symptoms have been observed after the discontinuation of frequently used more than weekly high doses of ketamine for a longer duration These symptoms of withdrawal have a higher chance of occurring if esketamine was similarly abused FDA label Symptoms of withdrawal reported to be associated with daily intake of high ketamine doses include craving fatigue poor appetite and anxiety Therefore monitor esketamine treated patients for symptoms and signs of physical dependence upon the discontinuation of the drug Tolerance has been reported with prolonged use of ketamine Tolerance is characterized by a decreased response to a drug following repeated doses i e a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was previously achieved at a lower dose Comparable tolerance would be expected to occur with long term use of esketamine FDA label Use in pregnancy This drug may cause fetal harm based on the findings of animal studies Pregnancy planning and prevention in females of reproductive potential should occur before the initiation of esketamine treatment FDA label There is a pregnancy registry for women who exposed to esketamine during pregnancy The goal of the registry is to gather data about the health of women and infants exposed to esketamine Use in lactation Esketamine is present in human milk No safety data on the effects of esketamine on the breastfed infant or on milk production are available Studies in young animals report neurotoxicity Due to the risk of neurotoxicity advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with this drug FDA label",
