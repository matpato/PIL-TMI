                "pharmacodynamics": "Conivaptan is a nonpeptide dual antagonist of arginine vasopressin AVP V sub 1A sub and V sub 2 sub receptors The level of AVP in circulating blood is critical for the regulation of water and electrolyte balance and is usually elevated in both euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia The AVP effect is mediated through V sub 2 sub receptors which are functionally coupled to aquaporin channels in the apical membrane of the collecting ducts of the kidney These receptors help to maintain plasma osmolality within the normal range by increasing permeability of the renal collecting ducts to water Vasopressin also causes vasoconstriction through its actions on vascular sub 1A sub receptors The predominant pharmacodynamic effect of conivaptan in the treatment of hyponatremia is through its V sub 2 sub antagonism of AVP in the renal collecting ducts an effect that results in aquaresis or excretion of free water Conivaptan s antagonist activity on V sub 1A sub receptors may also cause splanchnic vasodilation resulting in possible hypotension or variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis The pharmacodynamic effects of conivaptan include increased free water excretion i e effective water clearance EWC generally accompanied by increased net fluid loss increased urine output and decreased urine osmolality",
