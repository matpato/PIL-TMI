                "disease": "Although many national health agencies like the FDA and Health Canada have concluded that the addition or use of food additive sweeteners like xylose is safe and effective for their intended purposes of use in food it is also known that eating too much of these substances can also ultimately cause gastrointestinal discomfort and laxative effects L2428 These effects are largely the result of excessive amounts of ingested sugar alcohols being poorly taken up from the gastrointestinal tract L2428 Regardless the extent to which these kinds of effects occur depends on variances between individuals and it is also possible for individuals to develop a tolerance via frequent consumption of such sweetener containing products L2428 In doing so such individuals can increase consumption of these agents without experiencing adverse effects L2428 The acute oral toxicity LD50 for the mouse animal model has been recorded as 23000 mg kg MSDS",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Xylose is often used as a parent sugar alcohol from which the commonly used food additive sweetener xylitol can be derived via the hydrogenation of xylose A32661 Xylitol possesses many characteristics that make it a healthy and effective alternative to regular sugar For example although it looks and tastes exactly like ordinary sugar A32662 having a 100 relative sweetness versus normal sucrose L2428 it also has a low impact on blood sugar and insulin secretion and a minimal caloric value of 2 4 calories gm L2428 A32661 Furthermore xylitol is non fermentable and thus cannot be transformed to acids by oral bacteria allowing it to restore a proper alkaline acid balance in the mouth A32661 Various studies cite this effect for allowing xylitol products like chewing gum to be effective at reducing dental caries A32661 Altogether these characteristics make xylose and its xylitol metabolite an effective alternative sweetener for healthy food choices for individuals who may be diabetic or for individuals simply wanting to make healthy dietary choices for their bodies",
