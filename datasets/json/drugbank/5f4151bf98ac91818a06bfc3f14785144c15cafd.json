                "pharmacodynamics": "All cresol isomers are absorbed across the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract and through the intact skin L2019 Limited data indicate that cresols are widely distributed throughout the body after uptake L2019 Cresols are mainly conjugated with glucuronic acid and inorganic sulfate and excreted as conjugates with the urine L2019 At physiological pH the conjugated metabolites are ionized to a greater extent than the parent compound which reduces renal reabsorption and increases elimination with the urine L2019 In addition to urinary excretion cresols are excreted in the bile but the most part undergoes enterohepatic circulation L2019 There are know species differences in the specific conjugation reactions of cresol isomers and the relative amounts of glucuronide and sulfate conjugates therefore differ between species and also vary with dose L2019",
