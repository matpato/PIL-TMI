                "pharmacodynamics": "Rosuvastatin is a synthetic enantiomerically pure antilipemic agent It is used to lower total cholesterol low density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL C apolipoprotein B apoB non high density lipoprotein cholesterol non HDL C and trigleride TG plasma concentrations while increasing HDL C concentrations High LDL C low HDL C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease The total cholesterol to HDL C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease Increased levels of HDL C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk By decreasing LDL C and TG and increasing HDL C rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality A181087 A181406 Elevated cholesterol levels and in particular elevated low density lipoprotein LDL levels are an important risk factor for the development of CVD A181087 Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all cause mortality A181090 A181093 A181096 A181427 A181475 Statins are considered a cost effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all cause mortality including fatal and non fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack A181087 A181406 Evidence has shown that even for low risk individuals with 10 risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years statins cause a 20 22 relative reduction in major cardiovascular events heart attack stroke coronary revascularization and coronary death for every 1 mmol L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks A181397 A181403 Skeletal Muscle Effects Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors including rosuvastatin These risks can occur at any dose level but are increased at the highest dose 40 mg Rosuvastatin should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy e g age 65 years inadequately treated hypothyroidism renal impairment The risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid lowering therapies such as fenofibrate or niacin gemfibrozil cyclosporine atazanavir ritonavir lopinavir ritonavir or simeprevir Cases of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis have been reported with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors including rosuvastatin coadministered with colchicine and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together F4649 Real world data from observational studies has suggested that 10 15 of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment A182258 Liver Enzyme Abnormalities Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors including rosuvastatin In most cases the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy There were two cases of jaundice for which a relationship to rosuvastatin therapy could not be determined which resolved after discontinuation of therapy There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials F4649 Endocrine Effects Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors including rosuvastatin calcium tablets Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus F4649 An in vitro study found that atorvastatin pravastatin rosuvastatin and pitavastatin exhibited a dose dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreas islet \u03b2 cells with reductions in cell viability of 32 41 34 and 29 respectively versus control Moreover insulin secretion rates were decreased by 34 30 27 and 19 respectively relative to control A182012 HMG CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower cholesterol levels and as such might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production Rosuvastatin demonstrated no effect upon nonstimulated cortisol levels and no effect on thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH plasma concentration In rosuvastatin treated patients there was no impairment of adrenocortical reserve and no reduction in plasma cortisol concentrations Clinical studies with other HMG CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not reduce plasma testosterone concentration The effects of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied The effects if any on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown F4652 Cardiovascular Ubiquinone levels were not measured in rosuvastatin clinical trials however significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with other statins have been observed The clinical significance of a potential long term statin induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure F4652 Lipoprotein A In some patients the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL C levels may be partly blunted by a concomitant increase in the Lipoprotein a Lp a concentrations Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp a levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease It is thus desirable to maintain and reinforce lifestyle changes in high risk patients placed on rosuvastatin therapy F4652 Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp a levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo a phenotype statins increase Lp a levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo a phenotype A181418",
