                "disease": "Adverse effects of oral sympathomimetics such as Nylidrin are common The most frequent effects are hypertension palpitations nausea anxiety mydriasis and restlessness agitation L2286 Large overdoses and severe toxicity may lead to seizures hallucinations agitated delirium and tachydysrhythmias including supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia Vasospasm can lead to myocardial ischemia focal cerebrovascular deficits Severe hypertension may also result in intracranial hemorrhage or renal insufficiency Reflex bradycardia because of significant hypertension is possible Prolonged agitation can lead to rhabdomyolysis and hyperthermia L2286",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Nylidrin hydrochloride acts mainly by beta receptor stimulation A32529 L2297 Beta stimulation with nylidrin has been studied and confirmed in a variety of isolated tissues from rabbits guinea pigs as well as dogs This drug has been shown to dilate arterioles in skeletal muscle and to increase cardiac output in the anesthetized dog and cat as well as the unanesthetized man An increase in cerebral blood flow and a decrease in vascular resistance has also been reported The result of this combination of mechanisms is an improved blood supply to ischemic tissues with minimal change in blood pressure generally L2298 Nylidrin causes peripheral vasodilation a positive inotropic effect and an increased volume of gastric acid A32531 L2279 According to one study there are two primary effects of this agent following the intra arterial route of administration one to decrease total peripheral resistance and two a direct effect on the heart tissue to increase cardiac output L2297 It also acts directly on the arteries and arterioles of the skeletal muscles Additionally it suppresses uterine contractility thereby preventing or halting premature labor L2289",
