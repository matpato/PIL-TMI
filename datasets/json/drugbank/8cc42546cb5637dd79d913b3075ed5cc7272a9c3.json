                "pharmacodynamics": "Activity is mainly in the gastrointestinal tract with minimal effects reported on the brain and cardiovascular system accompanied by an excellent safety profile In normal mice telotristat etiprate administered once daily for 4 days at doses of 15 300 mg kg day was found to reduce serotonin levels throughout the gastrointestinal tract These reductions occurred in a dose dependent fashion with maximal effects observed with doses of telotristat etiprate 150 mg kg No significant change in brain serotonin or 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid 5 HIAA a serotonin metabolite was observed Similar findings were seen in Sprague Dawley rats Gastrointestinal motility studies were conducted in rats using the charcoal meal test There was a significant dose related delay in both gastrointestinal transit and gastric emptying associated with a reduction in blood serotonin levels and proximal colon serotonin A quantitative whole body autoradiography study was conducted to assess the absorption distribution and excretion of radioactivity in rats following a single oral dose of telotristat etiprate labeled with carbon 14 Rats were administered either 30 mg kg or 100 mg kg of the compound The distribution of radioactivity was limited to tissues of the hepatic and renal system and the contents of the GI tract There was no measurable radioactivity in the brain at any dose tested",
