            "therapeutic_indications": "Capacizumab is approved for the treatment of adults experiencing an episode of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura aTTP in conjunction with plasma exchange and immunosuppression in patients 18 years or older A174634 L5302 aTTP is a rare autoimmune condition presented by a disruption of blood clotting order which is translated into systemic microvascular thrombosis leading to profound thrombocytopenia hemolytic anemia and organ ischemia It is caused by the production of autoantibodies against ADAMTS 13 which is the protein in charge of cleaving the von Wilebrand factor The lack of this process produces the generation of ultra large von Wilebrand multimers that bind to platelets and form microthrombi and causing thromboembolic complications A174649 Previously capacizumab was under review for the prevention of thrombosis in high risk patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention but this indication was withdrawn A174634",
