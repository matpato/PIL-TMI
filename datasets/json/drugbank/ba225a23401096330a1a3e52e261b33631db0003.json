            "therapeutic_indications": "Dotatate gallium 68 is one of the most prominent radiopharmaceuticals used in imaging with positron emission tomography It binds to the somatostatin 2 receptor which is usually overexpressed in many neuroendocrine tumors in both adult and pediatric patients A31362 The neuroendocrine tumors are bening or malignant tumors produced in the hormone producing cells of the neuroendocrine system L1048",

                "pharmacodynamics": "The overexpression of somatostatin receptor in tumor tissue has been widely studied and the usage of scintigraphy for the diagnostic of neuroendocrine tumors has been happening since the beggining of the 90s The development of positron emission tomography there has been an emerging and growing field for the discovery of tracer labeled somatostatin analogues like dotatate gallium 68 A31364 Even after all the reportes the pharmacodynamic profile of dotatate gallium 68 has not been studied",
