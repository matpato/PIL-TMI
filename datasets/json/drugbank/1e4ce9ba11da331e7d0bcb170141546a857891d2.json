                "pharmacodynamics": "Cantharidin is a natural toxin produced by the blistering beetle that possesses both vesicant blistering and keratolytic effects A32891 A32892 The substance elicits these effects by inducing acantholysis loss of intercellular connections through the targeting of the desmosomal dense plaque resulting in the detachment of the desmosomes from the tonofilaments A32891 A32892 Cantharidin s effectiveness against warts is proposed to be a result of the exfoliation of the wart body as a consequence of the compound s acantholytic action F32 This acantholytic action generally does not go beyond the epidermal cells so that the basal layer remains intact and minimal effect occurs on the corium F32 There is consequently no scarring from the topical application of cantharidin F32",
