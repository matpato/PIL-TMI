                "pharmacodynamics": "Following a single intravenous bolus administration of etelcalcetide PTH levels decreased within 30 minutes post dose In the single dose study the extent and duration of the reduction in PTH increased with increasing dose Reduction in PTH levels correlated with plasma etelcalcetide concentrations in hemodialysis patients The reduction in PTH resulted in reductions in calcium and attenuation of post dialytic phosphate elevation The effect of reducing PTH levels was maintained throughout the 6 month dosing period when etelcalcetide was administered by intravenous bolus three times a week",
