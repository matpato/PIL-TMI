                "pharmacodynamics": "Bupivacaine is a widely used local anesthetic agent Bupivacaine is often administered by spinal injection prior to total hip arthroplasty It is also commonly injected into surgical wound sites to reduce pain for up to 20 hours after surgery In comparison to other local anesthetics it has a long duration of action It is also the most toxic to the heart when administered in large doses This problem has led to the use of other long acting local anaesthetics ropivacaine and levobupivacaine Levobupivacaine is a derivative specifically an enantiomer of bupivacaine Systemic absorption of local anesthetics produces effects on the cardiovascular and central nervous systems At blood concentrations achieved with therapeutic doses changes in cardiac conduction excitability refractoriness contractility and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal However toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and excitability which may lead to atrioventricular block ventricular arrhythmias and to cardiac arrest sometimes resulting in fatalities In addition myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure Following systemic absorption local anesthetics can produce central nervous system stimulation depression or both",
