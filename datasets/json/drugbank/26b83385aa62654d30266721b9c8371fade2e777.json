            "therapeutic_indications": "Ibuprofen is the most commonly used and prescribed NSAID It is very common over the counter medication widely used as an analgesic anti inflammatory and antipyretic A39096 The use of ibuprofen and its enantiomer DB09213 in a racemic mix is common for the management of mild to moderate pain related to dysmenorrhea headache migraine postoperative dental pain spondylitis osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis and soft tissue disorder A39097 Due to its activity against prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis ibuprofen has been attributed to alteration of platelet function and prolongation of gestation and labor A39092 As ibuprofen is a widely used medication the main therapeutic indications are Patent Ductus Arteriosus it is a neonatal condition wherein the ductus arteriosus blood vessel that connects the main pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta fails to close after birth causing severe risk of heart failure The prostaglandin inhibition of ibuprofen has been studied for the treatment of this condition as it is known that prostaglandin E2 is responsible for keeping the ductus arteriosus open A39100 Rheumatoid and osteo arthritis ibuprofen is very commonly used in the symptomatic treatment of inflammatory musculoskeletal and rheumatic disorders A39176 Cystic fibrosis the use of high dosages of ibuprofen has been proven to decrease inflammation and decreasing polymorphonuclear cell influx in the lungs A39177 Orthostatic hypotension ibuprofen can induce sodium retention and antagonize the effect of diuretics which has been reported to be beneficial for patients with severe orthostatic hypotension A1651 Dental pain ibuprofen is used to manage acute and chronic orofacial pain A10901 Minor pain ibuprofen is widely used to reduce minor aches and pains as well as to reduce fever and manage dysmenorrhea It is very commonly used for the relief of acute indications such as fever and tension headaches A39092 Investigational uses efforts have been put into developing ibuprofen for the prophylaxis of Alzheimer s disease Parkinson disease and breast cancer A39092",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Ibuprofen has multiple actions in different inflammatory pathways involved in acute and chronic inflammation The main effects reported in ibuprofen are related to the control of pain fever and acute inflammation by the inhibition of the synthesis of prostanoids by COX 1 and COX 2 Pain relief is attributed to peripheral affected regions and central nervous system effects in the pain transmission mediated by the dorsal horn and higher spinothalamic tract Some reports have tried to link the pain regulation with a possible enhancement on the synthesis of endogenous cannabinoids and action on the NMDA receptors The effect on pain has been shown to be related to the cortically evoked potentials A39190 The antipyretic effect is reported to be linked to the effect on the prostanoid synthesis due to the fact that the prostanoids are the main signaling mediator of pyresis in the hypothalamic preoptic region A39190 The use of ibuprofen in dental procedures is attributed to the local inhibition of prostanoid production as well as to anti oedemic activity and an increase of plasma beta endorphins Some reports have suggested a rapid local reduction of the expression of COX 2 in dental pulp derived by the administration of ibuprofen A39190 The administration of ibuprofen in patients with rheumatic diseases has shown to control joint symptoms A39092 Ibuprofen is largely used in OTC products such as an agent for the management of dysmenorrhea which has been proven to reduce the amount of menstrual prostanoids and to produce a reduction in the uterine hypercontractility A39181 As well it has been reported to reduce significantly the fever and the pain caused by migraines A39182 A39183 This effect is thought to be related to the effect on platelet activation and thromboxane A2 production which produces local vascular effects in the affected regions This effect is viable as ibuprofen can enter in the central nervous system A39190 In the investigational uses of ibuprofen it has been reported to reduce neurodegeneration when given in low doses over a long time A39184 On the other hand its use in Parkinson disease is related to the importance of inflammation and oxidative stress in the pathology of this condition A39185 The use of ibuprofen for breast cancer is related to a study that shows a decrease of 50 in the rate of breast cancer A39186",
