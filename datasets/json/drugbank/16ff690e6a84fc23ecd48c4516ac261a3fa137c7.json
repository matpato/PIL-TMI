            "therapeutic_indications": "Cod liver oil is predominantly manufactured marketed and used by the population at large as a general nutraceutical dietary supplement A27154 A33159 L2872 Historically cod liver oil was often given to children because the vitamin d content in the oil had been shown to prevent or treat vitamin D deficiency and condition of rickets associated with it A33159 Over time this common use in children growing up may have conferred upon cod liver oil its identity as a healthy and useful all purpose dietary supplement However since cod liver oil is a composite of several other nutritional compounds including the omega 3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid EPA and docosahexaenoic acid DHA as well as vitamin A and vitamin D A33159 L2872 L2871 the presence in varying amounts of all of these compounds at once makes it difficult to recommend or use cod liver oil as an appropriate supplement to confer any one particular health effect or for any one particular nutritional deficiency Regardless because it does contain a combination of a number of important and healthy nutritional compounds cod liver oil has sometimes been recommended in the literature for conferring the health effects of some of these compounds such as the potential use of cod liver oil supplements in post heart attack patients for secondary prophylaxis associated with the use of omega 3 fatty acids A33165",

                "pharmacodynamics": "As cod liver oil is a composite of several other nutritional compounds including the omega 3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid EPA and docosahexaenoic acid DHA as well as vitamin A and vitamin D A33159 L2872 L2871 the presence in varying amounts of all of these compounds at once makes it difficult to recommend or use cod liver oil as an appropriate supplement to confer any one particular health effect or for any one particular nutritional deficiency For example one tablespoon of cod liver oil contains approximately 4 080 ug of retinol vitamin A and 34 ug 1 360 IU of vitamin D L2871 Since the general dietary reference intake of vitamin A is only 900 ug per day for adult men 700 ug per day for women and 3000 ug per day as the tolerable upper intake level the regular intake of cod liver oil as a regular supplement can result in harmful levels of vitamin A accumulating in the liver and sufficient to cause hypervitaminosis A A33163 which is associated with various symptoms such as blurred vision changes in consciousness skin and hair changes liver damage among many others Moreover while cod liver oil only contains a certain percentage of the omega 3 fatty acids EPA and DHA per amount of the oil L2871 separate fish oils supplement products that exclusively consist of only EPA and DHA are available in a great variety of different percentage content formulations even including prescription strength formulations should certain patients need such a level of therapy Furthermore such exclusive omega 3 fatty acid supplement products do not contain any vitamin A or D either which allows patients to use the supplements without any concern about affecting their vitamin A or D levels or exposing themselves to the unnecessary excess intake of vitamins Subsequently although cod liver oil contains a combination of healthy dietary supplements like EPA DHA vitamin A and vitamin D the presence in varying amounts of all of these compounds all at once makes it difficult to effectively titrate for appropriate amounts of intake for all the compounds involved when using cod liver oil as a general supplement often resulting in either an excess or insufficient amount of one or more the aforementioned compounds Nevertheless because cod liver oil does consist of the component compounds of EPA DHA vitamin A and vitamin D further information about the pharmacodynamics of these cod liver oil components can be found by searching for fish oil vitamin A and vitamin D on DrugBank",
