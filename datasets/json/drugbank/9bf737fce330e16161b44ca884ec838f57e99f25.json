            "therapeutic_indications": "Protamine sulfate is indicated for counteracting or reversing the anticoagulant effect of heparin as necessary F3559 F3562 L5371 L5443 Such reversal may for example be required often before surgery after renal hemodialysis post open heart surgery whenever excessive bleeding results from heparin use and or for the treatment of heparin overdosage among other similar or related circumstances F3559 F3562 L5371 L5443",

                "pharmacodynamics": "When not complexed with heparin protamine sulfate by itself demonstrates a weak anticoagulant effect and also evidently prolongs the euglycaemic phase of the human body when used as an excipient in certain injectable insulin formulations F3562 Furthermore some animal studies have suggested that the long term oral administration of protamine sulfate may favourably decrease serum lipid concentrations presumably by enhancing the actions of the carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 and acyl CoA oxidase enzymes F3562 Related studies have also shown that protamine sulfate may be able to decrease intestinal fat absorption and might possess certain antibacterial effects F3562 Additionally studies have also determined that protamine sulfate elicits effects on the clotting factors human factor Xa and human antithrombin AT F3562 In particular it has been shown that protamine sulfate is capable of transforming and degrading factor Xa to inactive moieties transforming Xa AT complexes promoting the digestive degradation of primary Xa AT complexes to tertiary complexes and ultimately promotes a reduction in total complex formulation via the hydrolysis of factor Xa moieties F3562",
