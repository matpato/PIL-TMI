            "therapeutic_indications": "Testosterone enanthate in males is indicated as a replacement therapy in conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone Some of the treated conditions are 1 primary hypogonadism defined as testicular failure due to cryptorchidism bilateral torsion orchitis vanishing testis syndrome or orchidectomy 2 hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to an idiopathic gonadotropin or luteinizing hormone releasing hormone deficiency or due to a pituitary hypothalamic injury from tumors trauma or radiation in this case it is important to accompany the treatment with adrenal cortical and thyroid hormone replacement therapy 3 to stimulate puberty in patients with delayed puberty not secondary to a pathological disorder If the conditions 1 and 2 occur prior to puberty the androgen replacement therapy will be needed during adolescent years for the development of secondary sexual characteristics and prolonged androgen treatment might be needed it to maintain sexual characteristics after puberty FDA label In females testosterone enanthate is indicated to be used secondarily in presence of advanced inoperable metastatic mammary cancer in women who are from one to five years postmenopausal It has also been used in premenopausal women with breast cancer who have benefited from oophorectomy and are considered to have a hormone responsive tumor FDA label Testosterone enanthate injections that are currently formulated for subcutaneous use are specifically indicated only for primary hypogonadism and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism F1941 The use of such formulations is limited because the safety and efficacy of these subcutaneous products in adult males with late onset hypogonadism and males less than 18 years old have not yet been established F1941 Moreover subcutaneously administered testosterone enanthate is indicated only for the treatment of men with hypogonadal conditions associated with structural or genetic etiologies considering the medication could cause blood pressure increases that can raise the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events like non fatal myocardial infarction non fatal stroke and cardiovascular death F1941",
