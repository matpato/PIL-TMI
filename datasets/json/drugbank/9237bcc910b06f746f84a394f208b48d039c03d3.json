            "therapeutic_indications": "Nabilone is indicated for the treatment of the nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments This restriction is required because a substantial proportion of any group of patients treated with Nabilone can be expected to experience disturbing psychotomimetic reactions not observed with other antiemetic agents",

                "disease": "Symptoms of overdose include difficulty in breathing hallucinations mental changes severe nervousness or anxiety severe Monkeys treated with Nabilone at doses as high as 2mg kg day for a year experienced no significant adverse events This result contrasts with the finding in a planned 1 year dog study that was prematurely terminated because of deaths associated with convulsions in dogs receiving as little as 0 5mg kg day The earliest deaths however occurred at 56 days in dogs receiving 2mg kg day The unusual vulnerability of the dog is not understood it is hypothesised however that the explanation lies in the fact that the dog differs markedly from other species including humans in its metabolism of Nabilone",
