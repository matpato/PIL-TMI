            "therapeutic_indications": "18F is used as a bone imaging agent to define areas of altered osteogenic activity It has been indicated for back pain and otherwise unexplained bone pain child abuse abnormal radiographic or laboratory findings osteomyelitis trauma inflammatory and degenerative arthritis avascular necrosis Osteonecrosis of the mandible condylar hyperplasia and metabolic bone disease are also among the indications for fluoride imaging",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Deposition of 18F fluoride in bone appears to be primarily a function of blood flow to the bone and the efficiency of the bone in extracting the 18F from the blood perfusing the bone Increased fluorine F 18 ion deposition around joints can occur in arthritis or following trauma increased deposition has also been documented in bone around fracture sites in osteomyelities fibrous dysplasia spondylitis tuberculosa Paget s disease hyperstosis frontalis interna myositis ossificans and in rapidly growing epiphyses The tendency for fluorine F 18 ions to accumulate in the vicinity of primary and metastatic malignancy in bone has proven clinically useful in detection of such lesions",
