            "therapeutic_indications": "When incorporated as an active ingredient in combination with other active components like fish oils soya oil and olive oil as a prescription medication SMOFLIPID medium chain triglycerides MCTs constitute a therapy indicated for supplying energy calories and essential fatty acids to adult patients as part of a parenteral nutrition regimen when oral or enteral nutrition is impossible insufficient or contraindicated F126 F127 However given the predominant indication of MCTs for acting as a source of calories and essential fatty acids the use of MCTs alone or as a component part of various unique individual patient tailored composite regimen therapies MCTs are also ultimately indicated for a wide range of health conditions that involve energy deficiency malnutrition or disturbances in the ordinary absorption of dietary fats A33175 F128 Such conditions can include Crohn s disease Waldmann disease weight maintenance in AIDS cachexia and various disturbances in patient bile secretion like cholestasis disturbances in hepatic intestinal circulation of bile acids intestinal dysbacteriosis or in pancreatic lipase secretion like pancreatic failure in the course of cystic fibrosis A33175 F128",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Medium chain triglycerides MCTs are considered a fast acting source of calories and essential fatty acids for patients with malnutrition malabsorption or particular fatty acid metabolism disorders because they can passively and directly diffuse across the gastrointestinal tract into the portal system without undergoing the prolonged and necessary sequential molecular modifications that long chain fatty acids must undertake F126 These kinds of pharmacodynamics allow for much quicker absorption and utilization of MCTs compared to long chain triglycerides F128 In contrast albumin bound long chain fatty acids do not readily enter peripheral organs and are predominantly metabolised by the liver with a preference for re esterification to phospholipids or triglycerides and therefore potentially fat storage F126 MCFAs are subjected to a lower re esterification rate than LCFAs with a reduced tendency to fat storage than LCTs F126 Subsequently MCTs are predominantly catabolized rather than stored as adipose tissue and are therefore utilized as an immediate source of energy considering it does not require energy to absorb use or store MCTs F126",
