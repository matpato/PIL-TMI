                "pharmacodynamics": "Bezafibrate is an antilipemic agent that lowers cholesterol and triglycerides It decreases low density lipoproteins and increases high density lipoproteins Bezafibrate lowers elevated blood lipids triglycerides and cholesterol Elevated VLDL and LDL are reduced by treatment with bezafibrate whilst HDL levels are increased The activity of triglyceride lipases lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipoproteinlipase involved in the catabolism of triglyceride rich lipoproteins is increased by bezafibrate In the course of the intensified degradation of triglyceride rich lipoproteins chylomicrons VLDL precursors for the formation of HDL are formed which explains an increase in HDL Furthermore cholesterol biosynthesis is reduced by bezafibrate which is accompanied by a stimulation of the LDL receptor mediated lipoprotein catabolism Elevated fibrinogen appears to be an important risk factor alongside the lipids smoking and hypertension in the development of atheroma Fibrinogen plays an important role in viscosity and therefore blood flow and also appears to play an important role in thrombus development and lysability Bezafibrate exerts an effect on thrombogenic factors A significant decrease in elevated plasma fibrinogen levels can be achieved This may lead amongst other things to a reduction in both blood and plasma viscosity Inhibition of platelet aggregation has also been observed A reduction in blood glucose concentration due to an increase in glucose tolerance has been reported in diabetic patients In the same patients the concentration of fasting and postprandial free fatty acids was reduced by bezafibrate",
