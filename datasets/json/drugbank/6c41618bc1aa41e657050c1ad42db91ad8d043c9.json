            "therapeutic_indications": "The indications for this drug are as follows 1 As an analgesic adjunct in the maintenance of balanced general anesthesia in patients who are intubated and ventilated 2 As a primary anesthetic agent for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia with 100 oxygen in patients undergoing major surgical procedures in patients who are intubated and ventilated such as cardiovascular surgery or neurosurgical procedures in the sitting position to provide favorable myocardial and cerebral oxygen balance or when extended postoperative ventilation is anticipated 3 For epidural administration as an analgesic combined with low dose usually 12 5 mg per administration bupivacaine usually during labor and vaginal delivery 4 The sublingual form is indicated for the management of acute pain in adults that is severe to warrant the use of an opioid analgesic in certified medically supervised healthcare settings including hospitals surgical centers and emergency departments FDA label",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Effect on the Central Nervous System CNS In clinical settings sufentanil exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system Its primary therapeutic actions are analgesia and sedation Sufentanil may increase pain tolerance and decrease the perception of pain This drug depresses the respiratory centers depresses the cough reflex and constricts the pupils F2009 A39637 When used in balanced general anesthesia sufentanil has been reported to be as much as 10 times as potent as fentanyl When administered intravenously as a primary anesthetic agent with 100 oxygen sufentanil is approximately 5 to 7 times as potent as fentanyl FDA label High doses of intravenous sufentanil have been shown to cause muscle rigidity likely as a result of an effect on the substantia nigra and the striate nucleus in the brain Sleep inducing hypnotic activity can be demonstrated by EEG alterations FDA label Effects on the Respiratory System Sufentanil may cause respiratory depression FDA label Effects on the Cardiovascular System Sufentanil causes peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope Bradycardia may also occur F2009 Clinical signs or symptoms of histamine release and or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus flushing red eyes and sweating and or orthostatic hypotension FDA label Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract Sufentanil causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in both the antrum of the stomach and duodenum Digestion of food in the small intestine may be delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased while tone may be increased and lead to spasm resulting in constipation Other opioid induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions spasm of the sphincter of Oddi as well as temporary elevations in serum amylase FDA label",
