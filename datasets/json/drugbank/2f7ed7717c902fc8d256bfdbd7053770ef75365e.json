                "disease": "As lopinavir is only available in combination with ritonavir experience with acute lopinavir overdose in isolation is limited The risk related to overdose appears more pronounced in pediatric patients One case report detailed a fatal cardiogenic shock in a 2 1kg infant following an approximately 10 fold overdose of Kaletra oral solution while other reported reactions to overdose in infants include complete AV block cardiomyopathy lactic acidosis and acute renal failure The oral Kaletra solution is highly concentrated posing a greater risk of overdose and contains approximately 42 v v ethanol further increasing risk in children and infants L11163 There is no antidote for lopinavir overdose Treatment of overdose should consist largely of supportive measures and close observation of vital signs and clinical status of the affected patient Consideration should be given to the removal of unabsorbed drug using gastric lavage or activated charcoal if clinically indicated Dialysis is unlikely to be of benefit as lopinavir is highly protein bound but may help to remove ethanol and propylene glycol from the circulation in the case of overdose with Kaletra oral solution L11163",
