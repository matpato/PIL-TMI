            "therapeutic_indications": "Edoxudine was used in Europe in the form of a topical antiviral for the treatment of human herpes keratitis A32643 Human herpes keratitis is an inflammation of the cornea in the eye caused by herpes simplex virus infection This infection is a cause of significant morbidity whose incidence is significantly increased in the presence of recurrent infection and it can even produce corneal blindness A32645 Edoxudine 3 cream was also indicated for the treatment of dermal herpes simplex virus A32643 This virus can produce an infection ubiquitously and it is highly contagious There are two types of herpes virus type 1 that is mainly transmitted by oral to oral contact and type 2 that is sexually transmitted L2411",

                "pharmacodynamics": "In reports it has been indicated that at antivirally active doses edoxudine is phosphorylated to a much greater extent by hepatitis infected cells when compared to mock infected cells Once phosphorylated edoxudine is more highly incorporated into viral DNA than cellular DNA The level of incorporation into viral DNA highly seems to be correlated with the concentration of edoxudine The suppression of viral DNA synthesis caused a shutoff of viral replication and the viral titration is significantly reduced A27186 The effect of edoxudine is also proven to reduce significantly the lesion area produced by the viral activity to an even 44 reduction A32643",
