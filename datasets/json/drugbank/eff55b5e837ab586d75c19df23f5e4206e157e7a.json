                "pharmacodynamics": "Tetrahydrobiopterin BH4 is used to convert several amino acids including phenylalanine to other essential molecules in the body including neurotransmitters Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency can be caused by mutations in GTP cyclohydrolase 1 GCH1 6 pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase dimerization cofactor of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha PCBD1 6 pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase PTS and quinoid dihydropteridine reductase QDPR genes These genes make the enzymes that are critical for producing and recycling tetrahydrobiopterin If one of the enzymes fails to function correctly because of a gene mutation little or no tetrahydrobiopterin is produced As a result phenylalanine from the diet builds up in the bloodstream and other tissues and can damage nerve cells in the brain High levels of phenylalanine can result in signs and symptoms ranging from temporary low muscle tone to mental retardation movement disorders difficulty swallowing seizures behavioral problems progressive problems with development and an inability to control body temperature",
