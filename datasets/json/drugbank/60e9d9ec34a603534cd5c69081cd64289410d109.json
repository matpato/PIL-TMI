            "therapeutic_indications": "Tagraxofusp is indicated for the treatment of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm BPDCN in adults and pediatric patients over 2 years old This treatment allows an alternative for the previous intense treatment which consisted of intensive chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation L4893 BPDCN is a rare hematologic malignancy derived from plasmacytoid dendritic cells It is characterized by the significantly increased expression of cells expressing CD4 CD56 CD123 and other markers restricted to plasmacytoid dendritic cells and a lack of expression of lymphoid natural killer or myeloid lineage associated antigens A40274 A key feature of the malignant cells is the overexpression of CD123 also known as interleukin 3 receptor and the constant requirement of IL 3 for survival L4897",

                "pharmacodynamics": "In vitro studies showed that BPDCN blasts are ultrasensitive to tagraxofusp by presenting IC50 values in the femtomolar scale L4897 One of the main physiological changes of BPDCN is the presence of elevated interferon alpha and to produce an inflammatory response In trials with tagraxofusp and following cell depletion there was observed a significant reduction in the levels of interferon alpha and interleukin 6 L4896 In clinical trials tagraxofusp reported complete remission and complete remission with a skin abnormality not indicative of active disease in 54 of the treated patients L4893",
