                "pharmacodynamics": "Hypromellose is the most commonly used in hydrophilic matrix fabrication It allows for controlled release of drug substances increasing duration of therapeutic effects L1803 The physical characteristics of this drug resemble natural tears providing lubrication to the ocular surface and maintaining corneal hydration in dry eye syndromes L1811 Hypromellose is considered an inert substance as it has no direct pharmacological activity The viscosity promoting properties of hypromellose prolong the retention time and improve adhesion of synthetic tears to the cornea and conjunctiva As a result the tear film breakdown time is prolonged and or the tear film stability is enhanced A stable tear film protects the cornea from dryness and epithelial cells L1809 Hypromellose is a methyl and hydroxypropyl mixed ether of cellulose It is utilized as artificial tears to prevent conjunctival and corneal damage due to impaired lacrimal secretions It is also used as a visco elastic promoting agent by maintaining a deep viscous chamber and allowing for easier manipulation helping the vitreous surface to be pushed back thus preventing the formation of a postoperative flat chamber L1808",
