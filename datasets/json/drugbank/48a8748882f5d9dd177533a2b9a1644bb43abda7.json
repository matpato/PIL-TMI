                "pharmacodynamics": "It is intradermally administered to facilitate detection of active tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis Tuberculin PPD is an inactivated purified protein fraction obtained from human strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and antigen that induces a delayed hypersensitivity response after few hours following administration When the person has already acquired the tuberculin antigen the immune response is stimulated to produce antigen specific T cells that circulate in the bloodstream for up to several months and years Clinically a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to tuberculin is a manifestation of previous infection with M tuberculosis or a variety of non tuberculosis bacteria In most cases sensitization is induced by natural mycobacterial infection or by vaccination with BCG Vaccine The antigen causes pain edema and infiltration of immune cells in the injection area",
