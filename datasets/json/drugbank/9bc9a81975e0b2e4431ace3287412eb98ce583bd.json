                "pharmacodynamics": "Pyruvic acid or pyruvate is a key intermediate in the glycolytic and pyruvate dehydrogenase pathways which are involved in biological energy production Pyruvate is widely found in living organisms It is not an essential nutrient since it can be synthesized in the cells of the body Certain fruits and vegetables are rich in pyruvate For example an average size red apple contains approximately 450 milligrams Dark beer and red wine are also rich sources of pyruvate Recent research suggests that pyruvate in high concentrations may have a role in cardiovascular therapy as an inotropic agent Supplements of this dietary substance may also have bariatric and ergogenic applications",
