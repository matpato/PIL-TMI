            "therapeutic_indications": "Tideglusib was initially formulated for the treatment of Alzheimer and progressive supranuclear palsy A31601 The raising interest for the use of tideglusib comes from the significant upregulation of GSK 3 in the brain in patients with Alzheimer disease Its function as a degradant of \u03b2 catenin was also important as it prevents the transcription of cell survival genes All these factors have directed current research towards this kinase as a potential target A31603 Alzheimer disease is the most prevalent form of dementia The most accepted hypothesis to explain this disease is related to the presence of amyloid \u03b2 which triggers a cascade that will alter the Tau protein and provoke synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death A31605 GSK 3 importance in the tissue repair pathway has also pointed out a novel application for tideglusib Thus it is also under the research for the natural repair treatment of deep caries lesions A31602",
