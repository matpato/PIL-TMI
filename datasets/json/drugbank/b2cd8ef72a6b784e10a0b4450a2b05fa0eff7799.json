                "pharmacodynamics": "Effects on the central nervous system CNS This drug has CNS depressant effects which may include somnolence decreased alertness sedation drowsiness dizziness and other changes in psychomotor function FDA label Due to the above effects the FDA has recommended an initial dose of zolpidem immediate acting is a single dose of 5 mg for women and a single dose of 5 or 10 mg for men immediately before bedtime with at least 7 8 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening L5581 Refer to product labeling for detailed information F3802 FDA label Effects on memory Controlled studies in adults using objective measures of memory demonstrated no significant evidence of next day memory impairment after the administration of zolpidem On the contrary in a clinical study involving the administration of zolpidem doses of 10 and 20 mg a marked reduction in a next morning recall of information relayed to subjects during peak drug effect 90 minutes after dosing was observed These subjects experienced a condition known as _anterograde amnesia_ Subjective evidence from adverse event data has suggested that anterograde amnesia may occur after zolpidem administration mainly at doses above 10 mg FDA label Effects on psychomotor function This drug may cause decreased psychomotor performance Additive psychomotor effects may occur with other drugs that cause depression of psychomotor function including alcohol FDA label Patients taking zolpidem should be cautioned against participating in hazardous activities or occupations requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination including operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle after ingesting the drug Potential impairment of the performance of the above types of activities may also occur the day after zolpidem ingestion especially at higher doses and ingestion of the extended release form FDA label F3802 Effects on insomnia and sleep stages Evidence suggests that this drug is associated with minimal rebound insomnia During clinical trials with patients using zolpidem on an as needed basis zolpidem use resulted in global improvements in sleep A175426 Zolpidem has been demonstrated to decrease sleep latency the time it takes to fall asleep for up to 35 days in controlled clinical studies FDA label In studies measuring the percentage of sleep time spent in each sleep stage zolpidem has primarily been shown to preserve sleep stages Sleep time spent in stages 3 and 4 deep sleep was measured as similar to placebo with only minor and inconsistent changes in REM paradoxical sleep at the recommended dose FDA label Next day residual effects In 2013 the FDA issued a statement warning that patients who take zolpidem extended release Ambien CR either 6 25 mg or 12 5 mg should not drive or participate in other activities requiring full mental alertness the day after taking the drug due to the fact that zolpidem concentrations can remain increased the next day and impair the ability to perform these activities L5581 F3802 Patients may decrease their risk of next morning impairment by taking the lowest dose of their insomnia medicine that treats their symptoms according to the FDA L5590 Specific dosing recommendations for both men and women are included in this statement L5581 This information is also available on product labeling F3802 FDA label Rebound effects There was no polysomnographic objective evidence of rebound insomnia at normal doses in studies evaluating sleep on the nights following discontinuation of zolpidem tartrate Subjective evidence of impaired sleep in the elderly on the first post treatment night was observed at doses higher than the recommended 5mg dose for elderly patients FDA label",
