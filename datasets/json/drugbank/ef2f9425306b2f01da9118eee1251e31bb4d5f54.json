                "pharmacodynamics": "This physiologically active dermal substitute is a scaffold upon which tissue can grow allowing for effective healing of wounds L2418 Dermagraft is made from human fibroblast cells obtained from newborn foreskin tissue During the manufacturing process the human fibroblasts are placed onto a bioabsorbable polyglactin mesh scaffold The fibroblasts grow to fill the interstices of this scaffold and secrete human dermal collagen matrix proteins and growth factors as well as cytokines This creates a three dimensional human dermal substitute containing active living cells Dermagraft does not contain macrophages lymphocytes blood vessels or hair follicles L2418 Among other cytokines this device induces the production of interleukin 6 IL 6 This gene encodes a cytokine that functions in inflammation and the maturation of B type immune cells In addition the above the encoded protein has been shown to be an endogenous pyrogen capable of inducing fever in people with autoimmune diseases or infections The protein is mainly produced at sites of acute and chronic inflammation where it is secreted into the serum and induces a transcriptional inflammatory response through interleukin 6 receptor alpha The function this gene is involved in a wide variety of inflammation associated disease states including susceptibility to diabetes mellitus and systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis L2424",
