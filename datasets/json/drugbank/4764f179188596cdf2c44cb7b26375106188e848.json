            "therapeutic_indications": "For the treatment of patients with predominantly classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization due to age related macular degeneration pathologic myopia or presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome Verteporfin can also be used to destroy tumors",

                "disease": "Overdose of drug and or light in the treated eye may result in nonperfusion of normal retinal vessels with the possibility of severe decrease in vision that could be permanent An overdose of drug will also result in the prolongation of the period during which the patient remains photosensitive to bright light",
