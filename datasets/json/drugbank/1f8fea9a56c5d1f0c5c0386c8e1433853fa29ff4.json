                "pharmacodynamics": "The levels of cytokines chemokines and other blood molecules were measured over a 4 week interval after the drug infusion There were transient elevations of chemokines such as IL 6 IL 8 IL 10 IL 15 TNF \u03b1 IFN \u03b3 and sIL2R\u03b1 where the peak elevation was reached within the first 14 days after infusion and the levels gradually returned to baseline within 28 days FDA Label It is likely that axicabtagene ciloleucel may lead to B cell aplasia or low numbers of B cells or absent B cells as expected by other chimeric anntigen receptor T cell therapies",
