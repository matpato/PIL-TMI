            "therapeutic_indications": "Peanut oil is widely used in food and it is even the component for the adulteration of olive oil T41 It is used in over the counter ear drops to help lubricate the ear wax F124 It was also used as an ingredient in cleansing soaps in emollient cream preparations or in laxatives L2892 F125 Peanut oil is also used usually to solubilize drugs with poor water solubility as part of the oral formulation T224 When orally administered peanut oil has as well been researched and used to prevent heart diseases and lower cholesterol levels as well as to aid in weight loss and decrease appetite L2897",
            "contraindications": {
                "disease": "The use of peanut oil must be very well labeled as individuals with peanut allergy can have a severe allergic reaction The reactions can develop to anaphylactic reactions within minutes of the initial administration A33177",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Studies comparing the effectiveness between water based and oil based cerumenolytics have not been informative enough However most of the studies have concluded that both types of ear drops are as effective to remove the wax block and the use of this agents is preferred above the mechanical removal T225 Topically administered peanut oil effect can be observed as a softening and protection of the skin T226 Some population studies suggest people who eat nuts have a lower risk of developing heart disease This benefit must be weighed against animal evidence that suggests peanut oil is atherogenic perhaps due to the triglyceride content or the presence of a lectin L2897",
