            "therapeutic_indications": "Duvelisib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma SLL after at least two prior therapies L4586 The CLL is a cancer of the blood stem cells which are the blood cells that can develop into different types of cells In leukemia there is an overproduction of cells that are abnormal and do not mature into blood cells and thus they just crowd out normal cells and impair their normal function In lymphocyte leukemia the abnormal cell growth is observed in the lymphoid cells which are the type of blood cells that mature into lymphocytes The CLL is the type of lymphocytic leukemia that develops slowly over months or years L4587 The SLL is a very similar disease to the CLL and these terms are usually referred interchangeably The only difference between these two diseases is that in CLL the cells are found mostly in the blood and bone marrow while in SLL the cells are mainly found in the lymph nodes L4588 As well duvelisib obtained an accelerated approval for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma after at least two prior systemic therapies This approval is still under the status of continued approval and it is restrained to confirmatory trials L4586 The follicular lymphoma is a B cell lymphoma that clusters in the lymph nodes or other tissues L4589",
