            "therapeutic_indications": "Vorapaxar is indicated for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction MI or peripheral arterial disease PAD It is usually co administered with acetylsalicylic acid ASA and or clopidogrel and should therefore be administered as an addition to these medications as it has not been studied alone",

                "disease": "There is an increased risk of bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage ICH which is why the use of vorapaxar is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke trans ischemic attack TIA ICH or active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer Animal studies have suggested that there is a low probability of embryo fetal toxicities however there are no adequate and well controlled studies describing use in pregnant women Vorapaxar should also be avoided during breastfeeding as it is unknown whether vorapaxar or its metabolites are excreted in human milk however it has been shown to be actively secreted in the milk of rats",
