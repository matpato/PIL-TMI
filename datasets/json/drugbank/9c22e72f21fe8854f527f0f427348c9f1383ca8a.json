                "pharmacodynamics": "The _anthracycline glycoside_ group of antibiotics which includes amrubicin represent a group of potent anticancer agents with potent activity against both solid tumors and hematological malignancies They are the principal subjects of a large number of studies for the treatment of adult and childhood neoplastic diseases A32142 Amrubicin is a 9 aminoanthracycline derivative and promotes cell growth inhibition by stabilizing protein DNA complexes followed by double stranded DNA breaks which are mediated by topoisomerase II enzyme A32145 Anthracyclines have been observed to have a variety molecular effects for example DNA intercalation inhibition of topoisomerase II and stabilization of topoisomerase II\u03b1 cleavable complexes Amrubicin shows decreased DNA intercalation when compared with doxorubicin The decreased DNA interaction likely influences the intracellular distribution because amrubicin and its metabolite _amrubicinol_ Amrubicin showed 20 distribution into the nucleus of P388 cells compared with the 80 nuclear distribution shown by doxorubicin another anthracycline drug The cell growth inhibitory effects of amrubicin appear to be mainly due to the inhibition of topoisomerase II L1710",
