            "therapeutic_indications": "DHEA is taken as a supplement for a variety of unsubstantiated indications The following indications have shown promise and are backed up by some scientific evidence schizophrenia DHEA may be more effective in women than men improving the appearance of older people s skin taking DHEA by mouth seems to increase skin thickness and moisture and decrease facial age spots in elderly men and women improving ability to achieve an erection in men with sexual dysfunction Additionally DHEA has shown promise in improving symptoms of lupus SLE Taking DHEA by mouth along with conventional treatment may help reduce the number of times symptoms flare up and may allow a reduction in the dose of prescription drugs needed DHEA may also help SLE symptoms such as muscle ache and mouth ulcers DHEA also seems to strengthen bones in SLE patients being treated with high dose steroids corticosteroids DHEA also shows promise in the treatment of osteoporosis Taking DHEA by mouth daily seems to improve bone mineral density BMD in older women and men with osteoporosis or osteopenia pre osteoporosis DHEA may also increase BMD in young women with the eating disorder called anorexia nervosa DHEA is often prescribed in India for the induction of ovulation to improve chances of pregnancy",

                "pharmacodynamics": "DHEA is naturally produced from cholesterol through two cytochrome P450 enzymes Cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone by the enzyme P450 scc side chain cleavage then another enzyme CYP17A1 converts pregnenolone to 17\u03b1 Hydroxypregnenolone and then to DHEA DHEA is increased by exercise and calorie restriction Some theorize that the increase in endogenous DHEA brought about by calorie restriction is partially responsible for the longer life expectancy known to be associated with calorie restriction",
