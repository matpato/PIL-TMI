                "pharmacodynamics": "In human studies myocardial activity was noted within the first minute after peripheral intravenous injection of Rb 82 When areas of infarction or ischemia are present in the myocardium they are visualized within 2 7 minutes after injection as photon deficient or cold areas on the myocardial scan In patients with reduced cardiac function transit of the injected dose from the peripheral infusion site to the myocardium may be delayed Blood flow brings Rb 82 to all areas of the body during the first pass of circulation Accordingly visible uptake is also observed in other highly vascularized organs such as the kidneys liver spleen and lungs",
