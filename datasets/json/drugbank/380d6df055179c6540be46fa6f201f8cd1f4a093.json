                "pharmacodynamics": "Tecadenoson is a novel A1 adenosine receptor stimulator Adenosine is a naturally occurring compound that stimulates all adenosine receptor subtypes in the body including the A2 adenosine receptor which lowers blood pressure In non clinical trials tecadenoson selectively stimulated the A1 adenosine receptor in the AV node and slowed the speed of electrical conduction across the AV node reducing the number of electrical impulses that reached the ventricle without affecting blood pressure Clinical studies to date with intravenous tecadenoson suggest that it may slow the speed of AV nodal conduction by selectively stimulating the A1 adenosine receptor and may avoid blood pressure lowering by not stimulating the A2 adenosine receptor Thus it may be possible to use intravenous tecadenoson to convert patients from PSVT to normal sinus rhythm without lowering blood pressure or causing adverse events related to vasodilitation such as flushing palpitations or headache",
