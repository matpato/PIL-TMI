            "therapeutic_indications": "VN rzyl is indicated for the treatment of children and adult patients with confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutation associated retinal dystrophy The administration of VN rzyl is conditioned to the physician determination of the presence of viable retinal cells FDA label The RPE65 represents the LCA2 form of the Leber s congenital amaurosis LCA LCA is a group of inherited conditionts that involves retinal degeneration and severe vision loss in early childhood leading to total blindness by 30 40 years old The LCA2 form is associated with a mutation that interferes with the isomerohydrolase activity of the retinal pigment epithelium The isomerohydrolase activity transforms the trans retinyl esters to 11 cis retinal which is the natural ligand and chromophore of the opsins of rod and cones photoreceptors In the presence of RPE65 mutations the opsins cannot capture light or transduce it into electrical responses to initiate vision A31480",
