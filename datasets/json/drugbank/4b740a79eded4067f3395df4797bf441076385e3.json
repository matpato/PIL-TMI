            "therapeutic_indications": "Methadone is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate It s recommended that use is reserved for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options eg nonopioid analgesics opioid combination products are ineffective not tolerated or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain F4688 Methadone is also indicated for detoxification treatment of opioid addiction heroin or other morphine like drugs and for maintenance substitution treatment for opioid dependence in adults in conjunction with appropriate social and medical services F4685 F4691",
            "contraindications": {
                "disease": "In severe overdosage particularly by the intravenous route apnea circulatory collapse cardiac arrest and death may occur",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Overall methadone s pharmacological actions result in analgesia suppression of opioid withdrawal symptoms sedation miosis through binding to receptors in the pupillary muscles sweating hypotension bradycardia nausea and vomiting via binding within the chemoreceptor trigger zone and constipation Like many basic drugs methadone also enters mast cells and releases histamine by a non immunological mechanism leading to flushing pruritus and urticaria which can commonly be misattributed to an allergic reaction Compared to other opioids methadone has fewer active metabolites and therefore a lower risk of neuropsychiatric toxicity This means that higher doses needed to manage severe pain or addiction are less likely to result in delirium hyperalgesia or seizures A185900 A185903 Similar to morphine both methadone isomers are 5 HT 3 receptor antagonists although l methadone produces greater inhibition than d methadone Methadone s effects are reversible by naloxone with a pA2 value similar to its antagonism of morphine F4685 F4688 F4691 Dependence and Tolerance As with other opioids tolerance and physical dependence may develop upon repeated administration of methadone and there is a potential for development of psychological dependence Physical dependence and tolerance reflect the neuroadaptation of the opioid receptors to chronic exposure to an opioid and are separate and distinct from abuse and addiction Tolerance as well as physical dependence may develop upon repeated administration of opioids and are not by themselves evidence of an addictive disorder or abuse Patients on prolonged therapy should be tapered gradually from the drug if it is no longer required for pain control Withdrawal symptoms may occur following abrupt discontinuation of therapy or upon administration of an opioid antagonist Some of the symptoms that may be associated with abrupt withdrawal of an opioid analgesic include body aches diarrhea gooseflesh loss of appetite nausea nervousness or restlessness anxiety runny nose sneezing tremors or shivering stomach cramps tachycardia trouble with sleeping unusual increase in sweating palpitations unexplained fever weakness and yawning F4685 F4688 F4691 Cardiac Conduction Effects Laboratory studies both in vivo and in vitro have demonstrated that methadone inhibits cardiac potassium channels and prolongs the QT interval Cases of QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia torsades de pointes have been observed during treatment with methadone These cases appear to be more commonly associated with but not limited to higher dose treatment 200 mg day Methadone should be administered with particular caution to patients already at risk for development of prolonged QT interval e g cardiac hypertrophy concomitant diuretic use hypokalemia hypomagnesemia Careful monitoring is recommended when using methadone in patients with a history of cardiac conduction disease those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction and in other cases where history or physical exam suggest an increased risk of dysrhythmia F4685 F4688 F4691 Respiratory Depression and Overdose Serious life threatening or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of methadone Patients should be monitored for respiratory depression especially during initiation of methadone or following a dose increase Respiratory depression is of particular concern in elderly or debilitated patients as well as in those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia or hypercapnia when even moderate therapeutic doses may dangerously decrease pulmonary ventilation Methadone should be administered with extreme caution to patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia hypercapnia or decreased respiratory reserve such as asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale severe obesity sleep apnea syndrome myxedema kyphoscoliosis and CNS depression or coma In these patients even usual therapeutic doses of methadone may decrease respiratory drive while simultaneously increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea Alternative non opioid analgesics should be considered and methadone should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose Infants exposed in utero or through breast milk are at risk of life threatening respiratory depression upon delivery or when nursed Methadone s peak respiratory depressant effects typically occur later and persist longer than its peak analgesic effects in the short term use setting These characteristics can contribute to cases of iatrogenic overdose particularly during treatment initiation and dose titration F4685 F4688 F4691 Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure The respiratory depressant effects of opioids and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury other intracranial lesions or a pre existing increase in intracranial pressure Furthermore opioids produce effects which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries In such patients methadone must be used with caution and only if it is deemed essential F4685 F4688 F4691 Incomplete Cross tolerance between Methadone and other Opioids Patients tolerant to other opioids may be incompletely tolerant to methadone Incomplete cross tolerance is of particular concern for patients tolerant to other \u00b5 opioid agonists who are being converted to methadone thus making the determination of dosing during opioid conversion complex Deaths have been reported during conversion from chronic high dose treatment with other opioid agonists A high degree of opioid tolerance does not eliminate the possibility of methadone overdose iatrogenic or otherwise F4685 F4688 F4691 Crosstolerance between morphine and methadone has been demonstrated as steady state plasma methadone concentrations required for effectiveness C50 were higher in abstinent rats previously dosed with morphine as compared to controls Misuse Abuse and Diversion of Opioids Methadone is a mu agonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine Methadone like morphine and other opioids used for analgesia has the potential for being abused and is subject to criminal diversion Methadone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists legal or illicit This should be considered when dispensing Methadone in situations where the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse abuse or diversion F4685 F4688 F4691 Hypotensive Effect The administration of methadone may result in severe hypotension in patients whose ability to maintain normal blood pressure is compromised e g severe volume depletion F4685 F4688 F4691 Gastrointestinal Effects Methadone and other morphine like opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility and cause constipation This primarily occurs through agonism of opioid receptors in the gut wall Methadone may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions F4685 F4688 F4691 Sexual Function Reproduction Reproductive function in human males may be decreased by methadone treatment Reductions in ejaculate volume and seminal vesicle and prostate secretions have been reported in methadone treated individuals In addition reductions in serum testosterone levels and sperm motility and abnormalities in sperm morphology have been reported Long term use of opioids may be associated with decreased sex hormone levels and symptoms such as low libido erectile dysfunction or infertility F4685 F4688 F4691",
