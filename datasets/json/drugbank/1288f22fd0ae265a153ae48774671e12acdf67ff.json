            "therapeutic_indications": "Lidocaine is an anesthetic of the amide group indicated for production of local or regional anesthesia by infiltration techniques such as percutaneous injection and intravenous regional anesthesia by peripheral nerve block techniques such as brachial plexus and intercostal and by central neural techniques such as lumbar and caudal epidural blocks F4349 L5930",

                "disease": "Symptoms of overdose and or acute systemic toxicity involves central nervous system toxicity that presents with symptoms of increasing severity L5930 Patients may present initially with circumoral paraesthesia numbness of the tongue light headedness hyperacusis and tinnitus L5930 Visual disturbance and muscular tremors or muscle twitching are more serious and precede the onset of generalized convulsions L5930 These signs must not be mistaken for neurotic behavior L5930 Unconsciousness and grand mal convulsions may follow which may last from a few seconds to several minutes L5930 Hypoxia and hypercapnia occur rapidly following convulsions due to increased muscular activity together with the interference with normal respiration and loss of the airway L5930 In severe cases apnoea may occur Acidosis increases the toxic effects of local anesthetics L5930 Effects on the cardiovascular system may be seen in severe cases L5930 Hypotension bradycardia arrhythmia and cardiac arrest may occur as a result of high systemic concentrations with potentially fatal outcome L5930 Pregnancy Category B has been established for the use of lidocaine in pregnancy although there are no formal adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women F4349 General consideration should be given to this fact before administering lidocaine to women of childbearing potential especially during early pregnancy when maximum organogenesis takes place F4349 Ultimately although animal studies have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus lidocaine should not be administered during early pregnancy unless the benefits are considered to outweigh the risks L5930 Lidocaine readily crosses the placental barrier after epidural or intravenous administration to the mother L5930 The ratio of umbilical to maternal venous concentration is 0 5 to 0 6 L5930 The fetus appears to be capable of metabolizing lidocaine at term L5930 The elimination half life in the newborn of the drug received in utero is about three hours compared with 100 minutes in the adult L5930 Elevated lidocaine levels may persist in the newborn for at least 48 hours after delivery L5930 Fetal bradycardia or tachycardia neonatal bradycardia hypotonia or respiratory depression may occur L5930 Local anesthetics rapidly cross the placenta and when used for epidural paracervical pudendal or caudal block anesthesia can cause varying degrees of maternal fetal and neonatal toxicity F4349 The potential for toxicity depends upon the procedure performed the type and amount of drug used and the technique of drug administration F4349 Adverse reactions in the parturient fetus and neonate involve alterations of the central nervous system peripheral vascular tone and cardiac function F4349 Maternal hypotension has resulted from regional anesthesia F4349 Local anesthetics produce vasodilation by blocking sympathetic nerves F4349 Elevating the patient s legs and positioning her on her left side will help prevent decreases in blood pressure F4349 The fetal heart rate also should be monitored continuously and electronic fetal monitoring is highly advisable F4349 Epidural spinal paracervical or pudendal anesthesia may alter the forces of parturition through changes in uterine contractility or maternal expulsive efforts F4349 In one study paracervical block anesthesia was associated with a decrease in the mean duration of first stage labor and facilitation of cervical dilation F4349 However spinal and epidural anesthesia have also been reported to prolong the second stage of labor by removing the parturient s reflex urge to bear down or by interfering with motor function F4349 The use of obstetrical anesthesia may increase the need for forceps assistance F4349 The use of some local anesthetic drug products during labor and delivery may be followed by diminished muscle strength and tone for the first day or two of life F4349 The long term significance of these observations is unknown F4349 Fetal bradycardia may occur in 20 to 30 percent of patients receiving paracervical nerve block anesthesia with the amide type local anesthetics and may be associated with fetal acidosis F4349 Fetal heart rate should always be monitored during paracervical anesthesia F4349 The physician should weigh the possible advantages against risks when considering a paracervical block in prematurity toxemia of pregnancy and fetal distress F4349 Careful adherence to the recommended dosage is of the utmost importance in obstetrical paracervical block F4349 Failure to achieve adequate analgesia with recommended doses should arouse suspicion of intravascular or fetal intracranial injection F4349 Cases compatible with unintended fetal intracranial injection of local anesthetic solution have been reported following intended paracervical or pudendal block or both Babies so affected present with unexplained neonatal depression at birth which correlates with high local anesthetic serum levels and often manifest seizures within six hours F4349 Prompt use of supportive measures combined with forced urinary excretion of the local anesthetic has been used successfully to manage this complication F4349 It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk F4349 Because many drugs are excreted in human milk caution should be exercised when lidocaine is administered to a nursing woman F4349 Dosages in children should be reduced commensurate with age body weight and physical condition F4349 The oral LD 50 of lidocaine HCl in non fasted female rats is 459 346 773 mg kg as the salt and 214 159 324 mg kg as the salt in fasted female rats F4349",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Excessive blood levels of lidocaine can cause changes in cardiac output total peripheral resistance and mean arterial pressure F4349 L5930 With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to the block of autonomic fibers a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system and or the beta adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present F4349 L5930 The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded F4349 L5930 In particular such cardiac effects are likely associated with the principal effect that lidocaine elicits when it binds and blocks sodium channels inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of electrical action potential impulses necessary to facilitate muscle contraction F4349 L5930 L5948 Subsequently in cardiac myocytes lidocaine can potentially block or otherwise slow the rise of cardiac action potentials and their associated cardiac myocyte contractions resulting in possible effects like hypotension bradycardia myocardial depression cardiac arrhythmias and perhaps cardiac arrest or circulatory collapse F4349 L5930 L5948 Moreover lidocaine possesses a dissociation constant pKa of 7 7 and is considered a weak base L5948 As a result about 25 of lidocaine molecules will be un ionized and available at the physiological pH of 7 4 to translocate inside nerve cells which means lidocaine elicits an onset of action more rapidly than other local anesthetics that have higher pKa values L5948 This rapid onset of action is demonstrated in about one minute following intravenous injection and fifteen minutes following intramuscular injection L5930 The administered lidocaine subsequently spreads rapidly through the surrounding tissues and the anesthetic effect lasts approximately ten to twenty minutes when given intravenously and about sixty to ninety minutes after intramuscular injection L5930 Nevertheless it appears that the efficacy of lidocaine may be minimized in the presence of inflammation L5948 This effect could be due to acidosis decreasing the amount of un ionized lidocaine molecules a more rapid reduction in lidocaine concentration as a result of increased blood flow or potentially also because of increased production of inflammatory mediators like peroxynitrite that elicit direct actions on sodium channels L5948",
