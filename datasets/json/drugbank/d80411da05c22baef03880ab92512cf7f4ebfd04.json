                "pharmacodynamics": "Levobunolol is an ophthalmic beta blocker equally effective at beta 1 and beta 2 receptor sites Levobunolol reduces both elevated and normal IOP in patients with or without glaucoma In patients with elevated IOP levobunolol reduces mean IOP by approximately 25 40 from baseline As the drug is a nonselective beta adrenergic blocking agent it can produce both systemic pulmonary and cardiovascular effects following topical application to the eye These effects include adverse pulmonary effects eg bronchoconstriction increased airway resistance and a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate",
