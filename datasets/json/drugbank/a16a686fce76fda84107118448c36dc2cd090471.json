            "therapeutic_indications": "For use in patients who are not getting enough oxygen into their blood due to blockages in the lungs from pathological conditions or injuries Suggested potential benefit in upper airway obstruction in severe asthma and in exacerbations of COPD COLD Helium may be used in place of carbon monoxide during laparoscopic surgeries as it lowers the risk of developing respiratory acidosis in selected patients",

                "disease": "Little evidence of toxic effects from helium therapy in clinical settings Due to high thermal conductivity may cause hypothermia in case of prolonged administration",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Helium provides lung ventilation and prevents narrowing or collapse in respiratory units It increases the tendency to laminar flow and reduces the resistance in turbulent flow leading to more efficient penetration of gases to the distal alveoli higher minute volumes and improved ventilation",
