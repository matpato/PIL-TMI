            "therapeutic_indications": "Oxygen therapy in clinical settings is used across diverse specialties including various types of anoxia hypoxia or dyspnea and any other disease states and conditions that reduce the efficiency of gas exchange and oxygen consumption such as respiratory illnesses trauma poisonings and drug overdoses Oxygen therapy tries to achieve hyperoxia L745 to reduce the extent of hypoxia induced tissue damage and malfunction",

                "disease": "May cause burns or frostbites in case of eye or skin contact with rapidly expanding gas Oxygen therapy can induce hypercapnic respiratory failure in patients with respiratory diseases and musculoskeletal diseases in upper airways Sudden cessation of oxygen supplementation in these patients can further lead to rebound hypoxaemia In patients with mild or moderate strokes hyperoxaemia may cause absorption atelectasis or myocardial infarction Oxygen content should be monitored following the administration to verify therapeutic benefit",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Oxygen therapy improves effective cellular oxygenation even at a low rate of tissue perfusion Oxygen molecules adjust hypoxic ventilatory drive by acting on chemoreceptors on carotid bodies that sequentially relay sensory information to the higher processing centers in brainstem It also attenuates hypoxia induced mitochondrial depolarization that generates reactive oxygen species and or apoptosis Studies investigating on hyperbaric oxygen therapy has shown that oxygen supplementation can induce neural stem cell proliferation in neonatal rats thus promoting neurological regeneration after injuries A19117 CD34 CD45 dim leukocytes are also potential targets for hyperbaric oxygen therapy benefit as their mobilization was increased in vitro which could facilitate the acceleration of recovery at peripheral sites A19113",
