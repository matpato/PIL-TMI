                "pharmacodynamics": "Betazole is a histamine H2 agonist used in a test for measuring maximal production of gastric acidity or anacidity This measurement can be used to diagnose diseases such as Zollinger Ellison syndrome whereby the volume of gastric and basal secretions is measured following betazole administration greater than 60 of the maximal acid secretion following betazole stimulation In another test gastritis can be diagnosed given late absence of gastric acid which is unresponsive to betazole stimulation Betazole can be used as a gastric secretory stimulant instead of histamine with the advantage of not provoking side effects and thus not requiring the use of antihistaminic compounds",
