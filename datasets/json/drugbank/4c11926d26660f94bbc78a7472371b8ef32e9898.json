                "pharmacodynamics": "Miglustat an N alkylated imino sugar is a synthetic analogue of D glucose Miglustat is an inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase which is a glucosyl transferase enzyme responsible for catalyzing the formation of glucosylceramide glucocerebroside Glucosylceramide is a substrate for the endogenous glucocerebrosidase an enzyme that is deficient in Gaucher s disease The accumulation of glucosylceramide due to the absence of glucocerebrosidase results in the storage of this material in the lysosomes of tissue macrophages leading to widespread pathology due to infiltration of lipid engorged macrophages in the viscera lymph nodes and bone marrow This results in secondary hematologic consequences including sever anemia and thrombocytopenia in addition to the characteristic progressive hepatosplenomegaly as well as skeletal complications including osteonecrosis and osteopenia with secondary pathological fractures",
