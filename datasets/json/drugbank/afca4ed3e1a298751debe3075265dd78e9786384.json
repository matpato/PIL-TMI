                "pharmacodynamics": "Blood glucose is an obligatory energy source for humans involved in various cellular activities and it also acts as a signaling molecule for diverse glucose sensing molecules and proteins Glucose undergoes oxidation into carbon dioxide water and yields energy molecules in the process of glycolysis and subsequent citric cycle and oxidative phosphorylation A19406 Glucose is readily converted into fat in the body which can be used as a source of energy as required Under a similar conversion into storage of energy glucose is stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen T35 Glucose stores are mobilized in a regulated manner depending on the tissues metabolic demands Oral glucose tablets or injections serve to increase the supply of glucose and oral glucose administration is more effective in stimulating insulin secretion because it stimulates the incretin hormones from the gut which promotes insulin secretion T28",
