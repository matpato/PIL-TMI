                "disease": "An oral dose of 100 400 mg kg or a parenteral dose of 5 15 mg kg is believed to be fatal in humans L1816 A potential concern for larger concentrations of benzalkonium chloride to possibly cause corneal damage when implemented as an excipient ingredient in aqueous eye products is an issue that should be discussed between potential patents and their health care providers L1816 Since decreased regular blinking and tear generation in patients experiencing dry eyes due to any number of eye conditions can result in reduced dilution of applied eye drops containing the benzalkonium chloride preservative L1816 alternative options including benzalkonium chloride free products should be considered Additionally benzalkonium chloride has been reported to cause punctate keratopathy and or toxic ulcerative keratopathy In addition benzalkonium chloride may cause eye irritation and is known to discolour soft contact lenses L1816 There may also be the possibility of benzalkonium chloride containing eye drops to cause some stinging and pain L1816 There is the possibility of ototoxicity occurring when benzalkonium chloride containing ear drops are applied to the ear L1816 Benzalkonium chloride used as a preservative in nebulised solutions of anti asthma drugs has been reported to cause dose related bronchoconstriction especially in asthmatic patients and has been associated with the precipitation of respiratory arrest L1816 Despite the fairly widespread cutaneous use of benzalkonium chloride only limited human evidence of sensitization in relatively small populations of individuals have been reported L1816 Nevertheless the main adverse effect for topical formulations of benzalkonium chloride is usually the warning may cause local irritation L1816",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Benzalkonium chloride solutions are generally categorized as biocidal agents with relative long durations of action Their spectrum of activity has been demonstrated against bacteria to some viruses fungi and protozoa L1814 although bacterial spores are treated as being resistant to the agent Additionally the agent generally shows more activity against gram positive than gram negative bacteria L1814 Finally solutions of benzalkonium chloride are bacteriostatic or bactericidal based on their concentration Bacteriostatic agents act to prevent further growth of bacterial organisms that are present while bactericidal agents function to kill bacteria that are present A32203 In general the activity of the agent is not largely affected by pH but such activity does increase substantially at higher temperatures and prolonged exposure times",
