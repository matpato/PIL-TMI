                "pharmacodynamics": "Buprenorphine interacts predominately with the opioid mu receptor These mu binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain spinal cord and other tissues In clinical settings buprenorphine exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation In addition to analgesia alterations in mood euphoria and dysphoria and drowsiness commonly occur Buprenorphine depresses the respiratory centers depresses the cough reflex and constricts the pupils Dependence Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine in situations when the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse abuse or diversion F4718 Withdrawal Abrupt discontinuation of treatment is not recommended as it may result in an opioid withdrawal syndrome that may be delayed in onset Signs and symptoms may include body aches diarrhea gooseflesh loss of appetite nausea nervousness or restlessness anxiety runny nose sneezing tremors or shivering stomach cramps tachycardia trouble with sleeping unusual increase in sweating palpitations unexplained fever weakness and yawning F4718 Risk of Respiratory and Central Nervous System CNS Depression and Overdose Buprenorphine has been associated with life threatening respiratory depression and death Many but not all post marketing reports regarding coma and death involved misuse by self injection or were associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressant including alcohol Use buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function e g chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cor pulmonale decreased respiratory reserve hypoxia hypercapnia or pre existing respiratory depression F4715 F4718 Risk of Overdose in Opioid Na\u00efve Patients There have been reported deaths of opioid na\u00efve individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are not appropriate as an analgesic in opioid na\u00efve patients F4715 F4718 Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms If buprenorphine is started in opioid dependent individuals it will displace the other opioids and cause a phenomenon known as precipitated withdrawal which is characterized by a rapid and intense onset of withdrawal symptoms Individuals must therefore be in a state of mild to moderate withdrawal before starting therapy with buprenorphine Because it contains naloxone buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are also highly likely to produce marked and intense withdrawal signs and symptoms if misused parenterally by individuals dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin morphine or methadone F4715 F4718 Gastrointestinal Effects Buprenorphine and other morphine like opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility and cause constipation Buprenorphine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions and should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract F4715 F4718 Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone ACTH cortisol and luteinizing hormone LH in humans They also stimulate prolactin growth hormone GH secretion and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido impotence erectile dysfunction amenorrhea or infertility The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical physical lifestyle and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date Patients presenting with symptoms of androgen deficiency should undergo laboratory evaluation F4715 F4718 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use more often following greater than one month of use Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non specific symptoms and signs including nausea vomiting anorexia fatigue weakness dizziness and low blood pressure If adrenal insufficiency is suspected confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency F4715 F4718 Use in Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function Buprenorphine naloxone products are not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment The doses of buprenorphine and naloxone in this fixed dose combination product cannot be individually titrated and hepatic impairment results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a much greater extent than buprenorphine Therefore patients with severe hepatic impairment will be exposed to substantially higher levels of naloxone than patients with normal hepatic function This may result in an increased risk of precipitated withdrawal at the beginning of treatment induction and may interfere with buprenorphine s efficacy throughout treatment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment the differential reduction of naloxone clearance compared to buprenorphine clearance is not as great as in subjects with severe hepatic impairment However buprenorphine naloxone products are not recommended for initiation of treatment induction in patients with moderate hepatic impairment due to the increased risk of precipitated withdrawal Buprenorphine naloxone products may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone However patients should be carefully monitored and consideration given to the possibility of naloxone interfering with buprenorphine s efficacy F4715 F4718 Risk of Hepatitis Hepatic Events Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post marketing adverse event reports The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death hepatic failure hepatic necrosis hepatorenal syndrome and hepatic encephalopathy In many cases the presence of pre existing liver enzyme abnormalities infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role In other cases insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases however in other cases no dose reduction was necessary The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases Liver function tests prior to initiation of treatment is recommended to establish a baseline Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected Depending on the case buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated F4715 F4718 Orthostatic Hypotension Like other opioids buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients Elevation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure Buprenorphine like other opioids may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure and should be used with caution in patients with head injury intracranial lesions and other circumstances when cerebrospinal pressure may be increased Buprenorphine can produce miosis and changes in the level of consciousness that may interfere with patient evaluation Elevation of Intracholedochal Pressure Buprenorphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure as do other opioids and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract",
