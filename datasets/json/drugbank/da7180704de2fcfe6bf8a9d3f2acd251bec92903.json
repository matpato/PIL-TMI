            "therapeutic_indications": "Turoctocog alfa is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleedings in patients presenting hemophilia A L1105 The treatment with turoctocog alfa is related with its use to control bleeding episodes or as a perioperative management L1106 Hemophilia A is a hereditary hemorrhagic disorder generated by the congenital deficit of the coagulation factor VIII This disease is manifested as excessive spontaneous or trauma driven bleeding The coagulation factor VIII is a robust initiator of thrombin which is later required for the generation of fibrin to form a platelet plug and its gene is expressed in the X chromosome A31505",
