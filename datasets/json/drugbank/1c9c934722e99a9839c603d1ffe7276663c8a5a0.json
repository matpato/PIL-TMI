            "therapeutic_indications": "Montelukast is indicated for a the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and pediatric patients who are 12 months of age and older L6301 although other regional health authorities specifically note this indication for adults and adolescents who are 15 years and older L6304 L6307 and also include indications for preventing day and night time symptoms and the treatment of acetylsalicylic acid sensitive asthma L6304 b the prevention of exercise induced bronchoconstriction EIB in patients who are 6 years of age and older L6301 although other regional health authorities specifically note this indication for adults and adolescents who are 15 years and older L6304 L6307 and c the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 2 years of age and older and perennial allergic rhinitis in patients 6 months of age and older L6301 although other regional health authorities specifically note the relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms for adults and adolescents who are 15 years and older L6304 L6307 Furthermore some formulations like chewable montelukast tablets may also be specifically indicated by particular regulatory bodies for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma including the prevention of day and night time symptoms the treatment of acetylsalicylic acid based asthma and the prevention of exercise induced bronchoconstriction in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 and older L6328 between the ages 2 and 5 L6325 or between the ages of 6 and 14 years L6331 Moreover when employed for such indications montelukast is considered effective as monotherapy or when combined with other medications indicated for the maintenance treatment of chronic asthma L6304 L6328 For instance montelukast and inhaled corticosteroids can be used concomitantly to demonstrate additive effects to control asthma or to decrease the necessary inhaled corticosteroid dose while still maintaining clinical stability L6304 L6328 Additionally in patients who continue to experience asthma symptoms montelukast can also be combined with an as required short acting beta agonist an inhaled corticosteroid or inhaled corticosteroid paired with a long acting beta agonist L6304 L6328",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that demonstrates a marked affinity and selectivity to the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor type 1 in preference to many other crucial airway receptors like the prostanoid cholinergic or beta adrenergic receptors L6301 L6304 L6307 L6310 L6325 L6328 L6331 As a consequence the agent can elicit substantial blockage of LTD4 leukotriene mediated bronchoconstriction with doses as low as 5 mg L6301 L6304 L6307 L6310 L6325 L6328 L6331 Moreover a placebo controlled crossover study n 12 demonstrated that montelukast is capable of inhibiting early and late phase bronchoconstriction caused by antigen challenge by 75 and 57 respectively L6301 L6304 L6307 L6310 L6325 L6328 L6331 In particular it has been documented that montelukast can cause bronchodilation as soon as within 2 hours of oral administration L6301 L6304 L6307 L6310 L6325 L6328 L6331 This action can also be additive to the bronchodilation caused by the concomitant use of a beta agonist L6301 L6304 L6307 L6310 L6325 L6328 L6331 Nevertheless clinical investigations performed with adults 15 years of age and older revealed that no additional clinical benefit is obtained when doses of montelukast greater than 10 mg a day are used L6301 L6304 L6307 L6310 L6325 L6328 L6331 Additionally in clinical trials with adults and pediatric asthmatic patients aged 6 to 14 years it was also determined that montelukast can reduce mean peripheral blood eosinophils by about 13 to 15 from baseline in comparison to placebo during double blind treatment periods L6301 L6304 L6307 L6310 L6325 L6328 L6331 At the same time in patients aged 15 years and older who were experiencing seasonal allergic rhinitis the use of montelukast caused a median reduction of 13 in peripheral blood eosinophil counts when compared to placebo as well L6301 L6304 L6307 L6310 L6325 L6328 L6331",
