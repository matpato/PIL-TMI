            "therapeutic_indications": "Lovastatin is indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction unstable angina and the need for coronary revascularization procedures in individuals without symptomatic cardiovascular disease average to moderately elevated total C and LDL C and below average HDL C It is indicated as an intervention alternative in individuals presenting dyslipidemia at risk of developing atherosclerotic vascular disease The administration of this agent should be accompanied by the implementation of a fat and cholesterol restricted diet F4661 Therapy with lipid altering agents should be a component of multiple risk factor intervention in those individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia Lovastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated total C and LDL C levels in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia Types IIa and IIb2 when the response to diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and to other nonpharmacological measures alone has been inadequate F4661 F4664 Lovastatin is also indicated to slow the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with coronary heart disease as part of a treatment strategy to lower total C and LDL C to target levels F4661 Lovastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce total C LDL C and apolipoprotein B levels in adolescent boys and girls with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia HeFH who are at least one year post menarche 10 to 17 years of age with HeFH if after an adequate trial of diet therapy the following findings are present LDL C remains greater than 189 mg dL or LDL C remains greater than 160 mg dL and there is a positive family history of premature cardiovascular disease or two or more other CVD risk factors are present in the adolescent patient Before administering lovastatin it is important to rule out the presence of secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia and a lipid profile should be performed Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD Statin indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus clinical atherosclerosis including myocardial infarction acute coronary syndromes stable angina documented coronary artery disease stroke trans ischemic attack TIA documented carotid disease peripheral artery disease and claudication abdominal aortic aneurysm chronic kidney disease and severely elevated LDL C levels A181087 A181406",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Lovastatin is an oral antilipemic agent which reversibly inhibits HMG CoA reductase It is used to lower total cholesterol low density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL C apolipoprotein B apoB non high density lipoprotein cholesterol non HDL C and trigleride TG plasma concentrations while increasing HDL C concentrations High LDL C low HDL C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease The total cholesterol to HDL C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease Increased levels of HDL C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk By decreasing LDL C and TG and increasing HDL C lovastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality A174580 A181087 A181406 A181925 Elevated cholesterol levels and in particular elevated low density lipoprotein LDL levels are an important risk factor for the development of CVD A181087 Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all cause mortality A181090 A181093 A181096 A181427 A181475 Statins are considered a cost effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all cause mortality including fatal and non fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack A181087 A181406 Evidence has shown that even for low risk individuals with 10 risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years statins cause a 20 22 relative reduction in major cardiovascular events heart attack stroke coronary revascularization and coronary death for every 1 mmol L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks A174580 A181397 A181403 Clinical studies have shown that lovastatin reduces LDL C and total cholesterol by 25 40 A174580 The 50 inhibitory dose is known to be of 46 mcg kg which is translated into a reduction of approximately 30 of plasma cholesterol A174553 Myopathy Rhabdomyolysis Lovastatin like other inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase occasionally causes myopathy manifested as muscle pain tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase CK above ten times the upper limit of normal ULN Myopathy sometimes takes the form of rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred The risk of myopathy is dose related and is increased by high levels of HMG CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma In a clinical study EXCEL A181925 in which patients were carefully monitored and some interacting drugs were excluded there was one case of myopathy among 4933 patients randomized to lovastatin 20 to 40 mg daily for 48 weeks and 4 among 1649 patients randomized to 80 mg daily Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age 65 years female gender uncontrolled hypothyroidism and renal impairment Chinese patients may also be at increased risk for myopathy In most cases muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued The risk of myopathy during treatment with lovastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as fenofibrate niacin gemfibrozil cyclosporine and strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme Cases of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis have been reported with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with colchicine and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together F4661 F4664 Real world data from observational studies has suggested that 10 15 of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment A182258 Liver Dysfunction Persistent increases to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal in serum transaminases occurred in 1 9 of adult patients who received lovastatin for at least one year in early clinical trials When the drug was interrupted or discontinued in these patients the transaminase levels usually fell slowly to pretreatment levels The increases usually appeared 3 to 12 months after the start of therapy with lovastatin and were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms F4661 In the EXCEL study A181925 the incidence of persistent increases in serum transaminases over 48 weeks was 0 1 for placebo 0 1 at 20 mg day 0 9 at 40 mg day and 1 5 at 80 mg day in patients on lovastatin However in post marketing experience with lovastatin symptomatic liver disease has been reported rarely at all dosages F4661",
