                "disease": "Single oral doses of 120 mg which is 20 times the recommended dose of tegaserod were administered to three healthy subjects in one study F4223 All three subjects developed diarrhea and headache Two of these subjects also reported intermittent abdominal pain and one developed orthostatic hypotension F4223 In 28 healthy subjects exposed to 90 to 180 mg per day of tegaserod which is 7 5 to 15 times the recommended daily dosage for several days adverse reactions were diarrhea 100 headache 57 abdominal pain 18 flatulence 18 nausea 7 and vomiting 7 F4223 Although available data from case reports with tegaserod use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes animal studies involving maternal dietary administration of tegaserod with doses 45 to 71 times the recommended dose demonstrated decreased body weight delays in developmental landmarks and decreased survival in rat pups F4223 Caution and careful consideration of risks versus benefits are recommended before administering tegaserod to a pregnant woman Despite there being little if any data available regarding the presence of tegaserod in human milk the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production tegaserod and its metabolites are present in rat milk and the milk to plasma concentration ratio is very high in rats F4223 Subsequently because of the potential for serious reactions in the breastfed infant including tumorigenicity breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with tegaserod F4223 The safety and effectiveness of tegaserod in pediatric patients has not yet been established F4223 Tegaserod is not indicated in patients that are aged 65 years or older F4223 Tegaserod was not carcinogenic in rats given oral dietary doses up to 180 mg kg day approximately 93 to 111 times the recommended dose based on AUC for 110 to 124 weeks F4223 In mice dietary administration of tegaserod for 104 weeks produced mucosal hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma of the small intestine at 600 mg kg day approximately 83 to 110 times the recommended dose based on AUC F4223 There was no evidence of carcinogenicity at lower doses 3 to 35 times the recommended dose based on AUC F4223 Tegaserod was not genotoxic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung fibroblast CHL V79 cell chromosomal aberration and forward mutation test the in vitro rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis UDS test or the in vivo mouse micronucleus test F4223 The results of the Ames test for mutagenicity were equivocal Tegaserod at oral dietary doses up to 240 mg kg day approximately 57 times the recommended dose based on AUC in male rats and 150 mg kg day approximately 42 times the recommended dose based on AUC in female rats was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance F4223 Inhibition of the hERG human Ether a go go Related Gene channel was evident only in the micromolar concentration range with an IC50 of 13 micromolar approximately 1300 times the Cmax in humans at the recommended dose F4223 In in vitro studies tegaserod had no effects on impulse conduction in isolated guinea pig papillary muscle at up to 100 times the Cmax in humans Langendorff perfused isolated rabbit heart QT interval at up to 1000 times the Cmax in humans or human atrial myocytes at multiples up to 10 times the Cmax in humans F4223 The major metabolite M29 had no effect on QT in the Langendorff perfused isolated rabbit heart at multiples up to 323 times the Cmax in humans F4223 In anesthetized and conscious dogs tegaserod at doses up to 92 to 134 times the recommended dose based on Cmax did not alter heart rate QRS interval duration QTc or other ECG parameters F4223 In chronic toxicology studies in rats and dogs there were no treatment related changes in cardiac morphology after tegaserod administration at doses up to 660 times the recommended dose based on AUC F4223 Although tegaserod is expected to bind to 5 HT2B receptors in humans at the recommended dose there does not appear to be any potential for heart valve injury based on functional evidence of 5 HT2B receptor antagonism F4223 Studies with isolated coronary and mesenteric blood vessels from non human primates and humans showed no vasoconstrictor effect at concentrations approximately 100 times the human Cmax F4223 Tegaserod exhibited antagonism of 5 HT mediated vasoconstriction via 5 HT1B receptors F4223 In rat thoracic aortic rings that were pre constricted with phenylephrine or norepinephrine tegaserod produced vasorelaxation with IC50 values 6 and 64 times the Cmax plasma concentrations in humans respectively F4223 No effects were observed in the basal tone of aortic rings at concentrations up to 1000 times the human Cmax F4223 In studies with an anesthetized rat model for measuring macro and micro circulation of the colon intraduodenal dosing with tegaserod approximately 7 times the recommended dose based on Cmax produced no clinically relevant effect on blood pressure heart rate or vascular conductance F4223",
