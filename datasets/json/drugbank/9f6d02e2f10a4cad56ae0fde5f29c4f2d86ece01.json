            "therapeutic_indications": "Human calcitonin is indicated for the treatment of Paget s disease in the cases where the use of salmon calcitonin may provoke the generation of high titer of antibodies A32100 Paget s disease is a metabolic bone disorder characterized by focal areas of increased and disorganized bone turnover coupled with an increased bone formation The majority of the cases are asymptomatic but some clinical manifestations include pain bone deformity and some complications such as pathological fractures and deafness A32105 The increased activity in bone is associated with a rise in serum level of alkaline phosphatase and the increased urinary excretion of hydroxyproline which is a product of bone breakdown A32099",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Administration of human calcitonin has shown to increase bone calcium content and reduce the levels of serum calcium and serum phosphorus This calcium inhibition leads to decreases in urinary calcium magnesium and urine hydroxyproline Some reports indicate a calcitonin driven reduction of phosphate plasma concentration which is thought to be related to increased excretion of phosphate Calcitonin can increase excretion of calcium phosphate and sodium It also is proven to induce the appearance of normal lamellar bone against the diseased trabeculae and a striking decrease in the number of osteoclasts Bone pain tends to be relieved within a few weeks and it does not present an important effect on normal bone A32100 It is important to point out that human calcitonin is less active than the salmon calcitonin This characteristic happens because of a high tendency to aggregate and thus human calcitonin is used just in cases where the usage of salmon calcitonin generated the formation of antibodies A32107 For this reason the use of human calcitonin is only indicated when there is the appearance of a high titer of antibodies anti salmon calcitonin because these antibodies are suggested to cause a relapse A32100",
