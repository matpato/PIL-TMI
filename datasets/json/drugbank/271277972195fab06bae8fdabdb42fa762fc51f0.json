                "pharmacodynamics": "Tranylcypromine belongs to a class of antidepressants called monoamine oxidase inhibitors MAOIs Tranylcypromine is a non hydrazine monoamine oxidase inhibitor with a rapid onset of activity MAO is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of a number of amines including serotonin norepinephrine epinephrine and dopamine Two isoforms of MAO A and B are found in the body MAO A is mainly found within cells located in the periphery and catalyzes the breakdown of serotonin norepinephrine epinephrine dopamine and tyramine MAO B acts on phenylethylamine norepinephrine epinephrine dopamine and tyramine is localized extracellularly and is found predominantly in the brain While the mechanism of MAOIs is still unclear it is thought that they act by increasing free serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations and or by altering the concentrations of other amines in the CNS It has been postulated that depression is caused by low levels of serotonin and or norepinephrine and that increasing serotonergic and norepinephrinergic neurotransmission results in relief of depressive symptoms MAO A inhibition is thought to be more relevant to antidepressant activity than MAO B inhibition Selective MAO B inhibitors such as selegiline have no antidepressant effects",
