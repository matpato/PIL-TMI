                "pharmacodynamics": "Because ISIS 113715 is an insulin sensitizer that acts by increasing the activity of the insulin receptor in response to insulin the most logical place for this drug in the diabetes treatment regimen is as an adjunct to insulin therapy ISIS 113715 has a novel mechanism of PTP 1b inhibiting action and acts as an insulin signal enhancer with anti obesity and lipid lowering potential PTP 1b has long been recognized as an attractive target for treatment of diabetes but due to structural similarities among closely related proteins it has been difficult to identify small molecule drugs with sufficient specificity to be safe Antisense technology allowed for the design of very specific drugs that inhibit PTP 1b and that do not inhibit other family members making it possible to reduce PTP 1b activity without having other effects on closely related proteins that would likely lead to unwanted side effects",
