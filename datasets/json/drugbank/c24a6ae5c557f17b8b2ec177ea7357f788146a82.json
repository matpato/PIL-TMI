            "therapeutic_indications": "Diphenhydramine is a first generation histamine H1 receptor antagonist H1 antihistamine that is widely available as a non prescription over the counter OTC medication As an OTC medication diphenhydramine is typically formulated as tablets and creams indicated for use in treating sneezing runny nose itchy watery eyes itching of nose or throat insomnia pruritis urticaria insect bites stings allergic rashes and nausea L5263 L5266 L5269 F3379 A174541 Additionally when the use of oral diphenhydramine is impractical there are also prescription only formulations such as diphenhydramine injection products that are effective in adults and pediatric patients other than premature infants and neonates for i the amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma in anaphylaxis as an adjunct to epinephrine and other standard measures after acute allergic reaction symptoms have been controlled and for other uncomplicated allergic conditions of the immediate type when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated F3352 ii the active treatment of motion sickness F3352 and iii use in parkinsonism when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated as follows parkinsonism in the elderly who are unable to tolerate more potent agents mild cases of parkinsonism in other age groups and in other cases of parkinsonism in combination with centrally acting anticholinergic agents F3352",
