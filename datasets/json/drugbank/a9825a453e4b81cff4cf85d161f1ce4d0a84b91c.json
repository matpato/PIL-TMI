            "therapeutic_indications": "Dacomitinib is indicated as the first line treatment of patients with metastatic non small cell lung cancer NSCLC with epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations as verified by an FDA approved test L4812 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and NSCLC accounts for 85 of lung cancer cases From the cases of NSCLC approximately 75 of the patients present a late diagnosis with metastatic and advanced disease which produces a survival rate of 5 The presence of a mutation in EGFR accounts for more than the 60 of the NSCLC cases and the overexpression of EGFR is associated with frequent lymph node metastasis and poor chemosensitivity A40018 A19201",

                "disease": "The maximum asymptomatic dose in rats was 50 mg kg MSDS In animal studies dacomitinib was shown to induce embryo fetal toxicity as demonstrated by an increased incidence of a post implantation loss and reduced fetal body weight at doses resulting in exposures near the exposure at the 45mg human dose following administration in rats during the period of organogenesis On the other hand dacomitinib was showed to lack a mutagenic potential in a bacterial reverse mutation assay in human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay and in clastogenic or aneugenic in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay FDA Label The dose limiting and overdose toxicities include stomatitis rash palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome dehydration paronychia and diarrhea From these findings the maximum tolerated dose defined by the dose in which the dose limiting toxicities did not exceed 33 is 45 mg A40012",
