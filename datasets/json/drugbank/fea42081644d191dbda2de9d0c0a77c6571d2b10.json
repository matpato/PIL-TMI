                "pharmacodynamics": "General effects Codeine is a weak narcotic pain reliever and cough suppressant that is similar to morphine and hydrocodone A small amount of ingested codeine is converted to morphine in the body Codeine increases tolerance to pain reducing existing discomfort In addition to decreasing pain codeine also causes sedation drowsiness and respiratory depression A175096 Antitussive activity This drug has shown antitussive activity in clinical trials A175102 and has been effective in cough secondary to tuberculosis and insomnia due to coughing A175096 Codeine suppresses the cough reflex through a direct effect on the cough center in the medulla F3658 Effects on intestinal motility Codeine may reduce intestinal motility through both a local and possibly central mechanism of action F3661 This may possibly lead to constipation F3658 The chronic use of opioids including codeine sulfate may lead to obstructive bowel disease particularly in patients with underlying disorders of intestinal motility FDA label Effects on the central nervous system Codeine phosphate is an opioid analgesic with uses similar to those of morphine but is much less potent as an analgesic Its primary site of action is at the _mu_ opioid receptors distributed throughout the central nervous system The sedative activities of codeine are less potent than those of morphine F3658 Codeine may cause respiratory system depression by the activation of \u03bc opioid receptors at specific sites in the central nervous system A175108 Effects on blood pressure This drug poses an increased risk of compromised ability to maintain blood pressure due to peripheral vasodilation and other mechanisms FDA label Effects on chronic cancer pain and other types of pain Codeine is an opioid analgesic with similar indications to those of morphine however is much less potent in its pain alleviating properties Its primary action takes place at the mu opioid receptors which are distributed throughout the central nervous system The average duration of action is about 4 hours F3658 Regular dosing of opioid analgesics such as codeine in patients with severe cancer pain has been well documented to improve symptoms A175096 A175105",
