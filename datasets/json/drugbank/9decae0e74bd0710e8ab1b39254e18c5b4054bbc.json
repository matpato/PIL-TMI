                "pharmacodynamics": "Isradipine decreases arterial smooth muscle contractility and subsequent vasoconstriction by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions through L type calcium channels Calcium ions entering the cell through these channels bind to calmodulin Calcium bound calmodulin then binds to and activates myosin light chain kinase MLCK Activated MLCK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain subunit of myosin a key step in muscle contraction Signal amplification is achieved by calcium induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors Inhibition of the initial influx of calcium decreases the contractile activity of arterial smooth muscle cells and results in vasodilation The vasodilatory effects of isradipine result in an overall decrease in blood pressure",
