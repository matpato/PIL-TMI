            "therapeutic_indications": "Carbidopa is indicated with levodopa for the treatment of symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson disease postencephalitic parkinsonism and symptomatic parkinsonism followed by carbon monoxide or manganese intoxication FDA label The combination therapy is administered for the reduction of levodopa driven nausea and vomiting FDA label The product of carbidopa should be used in patients where the combination therapy of carbidopa levodopa provide less than the adequate daily dosage FDA label As well carbidopa can be used in patients where the dosages of carbidopa and levodopa require individual titration FDA label",

                "pharmacodynamics": "When mixed with levodopa carbidopa inhibits the peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine and the decarboxylation of oxitriptan to serotonin by aromatic L amino acid decarboxylase This results in an increased amount of levodopa and oxitriptan available for transport to the central nervous system Carbidopa also inhibits the metabolism of levodopa in the GI tract thus increasing the bioavailability of levodopa A13607 The presence of additional units of circulating levodopa can increase the effectiveness of the still functional dopaminergic neurons and it has been shown to alleviate symptoms for a time The action of carbidopa is very important as levodopa is able to cross the blood brain barrier while dopamine cannot T28 Hence the administration of carbidopa is essential to prevent the transformation of external levodopa to dopamine before reaching the main action site in the brain The coadministration of carbidopa with levodopa has been shown to increase the half life of levodopa more than 1 5 times while increasing the plasma level and decreasing clearance The combination therapy has also shown an increase of the recovery of levodopa in urine instead of dopamine which proves a reduced metabolism This effect has been highly observed by a significant reduction in levodopa requirements and a significant reduction in the presence of side effects such as nausea It has been observed that the effect of carbidopa is not dose dependent T394",
