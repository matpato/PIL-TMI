                "pharmacodynamics": "Cisplatin is an antineoplastic in the class of alkylating agents and is used to treat various forms of cancer Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells They stop tumor growth by cross linking guanine bases in DNA double helix strands directly attacking DNA This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate As this is necessary in DNA replication the cells can no longer divide In addition these drugs add methyl or other alkyl groups onto molecules where they do not belong which in turn inhibits their correct utilization by base pairing and causes a miscoding of DNA Alkylating agents are cell cycle nonspecific Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms all of which achieve the same end result disruption of DNA function and cell death",
