                "pharmacodynamics": "As thrombin alfa a recombinant thrombin is considered to be identical in amino acid sequence and structural similarity to naturally occurring human thrombin it is believed that thrombin alfa shares the same pharmacodynamics as endogenous or natural human thrombin coagulation factor L2079 In the natural blood coagulation pathway of the human body thrombin functions as a coagulation factor that converts clotting factor XI to XIa factor VIII to VIIIa V to Va fibrinogen to fibrin and XIII to XIIIa A32408 Specifically clotting factor XIIIa is a transglutaminase that catalyzes the formation of covalent bonds between the lysine and glutamine residues found in fibrin These covalent bonds assist in increasing the stability of the fibrin clot A32408 Additionally thrombin also promotes the activation and aggregation of platelets by way of activating protease activated receptors on the cell membranes of platelets A32408",
