            "therapeutic_indications": "Dinutuximab is indicated in combination with granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GM CSF interleukin 2 IL 2 and 13 cis retinoic acid RA for the treatment of pediatric patients with high risk neuroblastoma who achieve at least a partial response to prior first line multiagent multimodality therapy Despite a high clinical response seen after first line treatment the complete eradication of neuroblastoma is rarely achieved and the majority of patients with advanced disease suffer a relapse Current strategies for treatment include immunotherapy with drugs such as dinutuximab to target surviving neuroblastoma cells and to prevent relapse",
