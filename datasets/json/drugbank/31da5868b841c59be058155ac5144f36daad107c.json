                "pharmacodynamics": "KW 7158 is a tricyclic compound with a non cholingergic mechanism of action for the treatment of urinary urgency frequent urination and urinary incontinence associated with bladder overactivity involuntary abnormal contraction of the bladder As the aging of population progresses an increasing number of people are likely to suffer from urinary incontinence Bladder overactivity the indication for this compound is estimated to affect around 2 4 million people in Japan and around 20 million in the US and Europe combined We consider that the market for this therapeutic domain which is characterised by the predominance of untreated patients tends to grow The current mainstay of treatment for bladder overactivity is anti cholinergic agents which however are associated with high incidences of adverse reactions such as thirst and urination disorder The development of a new type of drugs particularly those causing fewer side effects is thus anticipated",
