                "pharmacodynamics": "Carbon monoxide is used to measure the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide DLCO also known as the transfer factor for carbon monoxide It is a measure of the gas transfer from inspired gas to the circulatory system red blood cells in particular L2557 It is used in a particular pulmonary function test called the single breath test F5 DLCO measured for clinical and research purposes almost exclusively by the single breath method is an important and very useful pulmonary function test It is useful in the evaluation of patients with dyspnea obstructive lung diseases restrictive lung diseases and in patients with diseases of the pulmonary vasculature The measurement of DLCO using carbon monoxide is representative of the surface area available the volume of blood present in the pulmonary capillaries as well as the thickness of the alveolar capillary membrane F5 Conditions that increase DLCO Heart failure erythrocythemia alveolar hemorrhage asthma Conditions that decrease DLCO emphysema pulmonary fibrosis pulmonary hypertension pulmonary embolism In addition to the above uses carbon monoxide CO is increasingly being accepted in recent years as a protective molecule with important signaling capabilities in both physiological homeostatic and pathophysiological situations The endogenous production of CO occurs via the activity of constitutive heme oxygenase 2 and inducible heme oxygenase 1 heme oxygenase enzymes which are both responsible for the breakdown of heme Through the generation of its products which in addition to carbon monoxide includes the biliary pigments biliverdin bilirubin and ferrous iron the heme oxygenase 1 system also have an essential role in the regulation of the stress response and in cell adaptation to injury Preclinical studies have suggested potential benefits of carbon monoxide in cardiovascular disease inflammatory disorders as well as organ transplantation A32731",
