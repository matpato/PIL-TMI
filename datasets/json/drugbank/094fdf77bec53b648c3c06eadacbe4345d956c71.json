                "pharmacodynamics": "DG031 is an inhibitor of 5 lipoxygenase activating protein or FLAP deCODE has linked variants in the gene encoding FLAP and the gene encoding leukotriene A4 hydrolase LTA4H to risk of heart attack These variants appear to confer increased risk of heart attack by increasing the production of leukotriene B4 LTB4 a potent driver of inflammation produced in atherosclerotic plaques In Phase II trials completed last year DG031 was shown to be well tolerated at all doses tested and to reduce the production of LTB4 in a dose dependent manner Late last year deCODE discovered that the HapK variant of the LTA4H gene discovered in Iceland and which confers a moderate increase in risk of heart attack in people of predominantly European ancestry confers a 250 increase in risk of the disease in African Americans deCODE licensed DG031 from Bayer AG which developed it originally for the treatment of asthma In deCODE s clinical trials and those conducted previously by Bayer a total of approximately 2000 people have been dosed with DG031",
