                "pharmacodynamics": "Irinotecan is an antineoplastic enzyme inhibitor primarily used in the treatment of colorectal cancer Irinotecan is a semisynthetic derivative of camptothecin Camptothecins interact specifically with topoisomerase I an enzyme in the cell nucleus that regulates DNA topology and facilitates nuclear processes such as DNA replication recombination and repair During these processes topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single strand breaks allowing single DNA strands to pass through the break The 3 DNA terminus of the broken DNA strands bind covalently with the topoisomerase enzyme to form a catalytic intermediate called a cleavable complex After the DNA is sufficiently relaxed and the strand passage reaction is complete DNA topoisomerase reattaches the broken DNA strands to form the chemically unaltered topoisomers that allow transcription to proceed Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN 38 bind to the topoisomerase I DNA complex and prevent religation of these single strand breaks Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I DNA and either Irinotecan or SN 38 Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double strand breaks The precise contribution of SN 38 to the activity of irinotecan in humans is not known Irinotecan is cell cycle phase specific S phase",
