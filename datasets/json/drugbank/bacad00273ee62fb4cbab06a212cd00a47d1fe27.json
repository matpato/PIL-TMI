                "pharmacodynamics": "Progesterone depending on concentration and dosage form and timing of exposure may have several pharmacodynamic effects These actions according to various preparations are listed below General effects Progesterone is the main hormone of the corpus luteum and the placenta It acts on the uterus by changing the proliferative phase to the secretory phase of the endometrium inner mucous lining of the uterus This hormone stimulated by a hormone called _luteinizing hormone_ LH is the main hormone during the secretory phase to prepare the corpus luteum and the endometrium for implantation of a fertilized ovum As the luteal phase concludes the progesterone hormone sends negative feedback to the anterior pituitary gland in the brain to decrease FSH follicle stimulating hormone and LH luteinizing hormone levels This prevents ovulation and maturation of oocytes immature egg cells The endometrium then prepares for pregnancy by increasing its vascularity blood vessels and stimulating mucous secretion This process occurs by progesterone stimulating the endometrium to decrease endometrial proliferation leading to a decreased uterine lining thickness developing more complex uterine glands collecting energy in the form of glycogen and providing more uterine blood vessel surface area suitable for supporting a growing embryo As opposed to cervical mucous changes observed during the proliferative phase and ovulation progesterone decreases and thickens the cervical mucus rendering it less elastic This change occurs because the fertilization time period has passed and a specific consistency of mucous amenable to sperm entry is no longer required T490 Gelatinized capsules Progesterone capsules are an oral dosage form of micronized progesterone which chemically identical to progesterone of ovarian origin Progesterone capsules have all the properties of endogenous progesterone with induction of a secretory phase endometrium with gestagenic antiestrogenic slightly antiandrogenic and anti aldosterone effects F3913 Progesterone opposes the effects of estrogen on the uterus and is beneficial in women with unopposed estrogen exposure which carries an increased risk of malignancy F3913 Vaginal gel and vaginal insert The gel preparation mimics the effects of naturally occurring progesterone In the presence of adequate levels of estrogen progesterone converts a proliferative endometrium into secretory endometrium This means that the endometrium changes from a growing and thickening stage into a subsequent preparation stage for pregnancy which involves further preparatory changes Progesterone is necessary for the development of decidual tissue specialized tissue amenable to supporting a possible pregnancy Progesterone is required to increase endometrial receptivity for the implantation of a fertilized embryo Once an embryo is implanted progesterone helps to maintain the pregnancy F3898 Injection intramuscular Intramuscularly injected progesterone increases serum progesterone and aids in the prevention of endometrial tissue overgrowth due to unopposed estrogen which leads to abnormal uterine bleeding and sometimes uterine cancer L5638 F3916 In the absence or deficiency of progesterone the endometrium continually proliferates eventually outgrowing its limited blood supply shedding incompletely and leading to abnormal and or profuse bleeding as well as malignancy L5638 Tablets contraceptive Progesterone only contraceptive tablets prevent conception by suppressing ovulation in about half of users causing a thickening of cervical mucus to inhibit sperm movement lowering the midcycle LH and FSH hormone peaks slowing the movement of the ovum through the fallopian tubes and causing secretory changes in the endometrium as described above F3904",
