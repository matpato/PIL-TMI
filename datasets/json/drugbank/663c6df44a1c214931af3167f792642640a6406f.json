            "therapeutic_indications": "Ivabradine is indicated by the FDA to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure in adult patients with stable symptomatic chronic heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction 35 who are in sinus rhythm with resting heart rate 70 beats per minute and either are on maximally tolerated doses of beta blockers or have a contraindication to beta blocker use It is also indicated for treatment of stable symptomatic heart failure as a result of dilated cardiomyopathy for pediatric patients 6 months of age or more FDA Label",
