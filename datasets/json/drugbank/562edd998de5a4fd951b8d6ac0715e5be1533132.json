                "pharmacodynamics": "PX 12 is a small molecule irreversible inhibitor of the redox protein thioredoxin Thioredoxin is involved in the first unique step in DNA synthesis Thioredoxin also provides control over a number of transcription factors affecting cell proliferation and death through the mechanism of redox regulation Trx regulates cell growth through the following steps 1 Trx is reduced into its active state Trx red by the enzyme thioredoxin reductase 2 Trx enters the nucleus to regulate transcription factor activity factors which affect DNA replication 3 Trx is excreted out of cell where it works with other growth factors GF to stimulate cell growth It has been shown that many cancer cells secrete thioredoxin increased levels of thioredoxin protein have been reported in a wide range of human cancers including hepatoma lung squamous cervical carcinoma primary gastric cancers and colorectal carcinomas thioredoxin stimulates the growth of a wide variety of human leukemia and solid tumor cell lines thioredoxin when it is over produced transforms normal cells into cancer cells thioredoxin is a potent inhibitor of apoptosis and provides a survival as well as a growth advantage to tumors elevated tumor thioredoxin levels have been associated with decreased patient survival in colon cancer and NSCLC and elevated thioredoxin levels cause a decrease in sensitivity of cells to cancer drugs such as doxorubicin 14 fold vincristine 8 fold cisplatin 5 fold and cytosine arabinoside 13 fold Therefore PX 12 by limiting the over expression of thioredoxin in human tumors could reduce resistance to chemotherapy",
