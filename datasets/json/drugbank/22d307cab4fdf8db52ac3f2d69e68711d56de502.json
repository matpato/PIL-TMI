            "therapeutic_indications": "The primary health related use for which alpha tocopherol acetate is formally indicated is as a dietary supplement for patients who demonstrate a genuine vitamin E deficiency At the same time vitamin E deficiency is generally quite rare but may occur in premature babies of very low birth weight 1500 grams individuals with fat malabsorption disorders as fat is required for the digestive tract to absorb vitamin E or individuals with abetalipoproteinemia a rare inherited disorder that causes poor absorption of dietary fat who require extremely large doses of supplemental vitamin E daily around 100 mg kg or 5 10 g day L2120 In all such cases alpha tocopherol is largely the preferred form of vitamin E to be administered Elsewhere vitamin E s chemical profile as a fat soluble antioxidant that is capable of neutralizing free radicals in the body continues to generate ongoing interest and study regarding how and whether or not the vitamin can help prevent or delay various chronic diseases associated with free radicals or other potential biological effects that vitamin E possesses like cardiovascular diseases diabetes ocular conditions immune illnesses cancer and more T166 None of these ongoing studies have yet to elucidate any formally significant evidence however T166",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Of the eight separate variants of vitamin E alpha tocopherol is the predominant form of vitamin E in human and animal tissues and it has the highest bioavailability L2250 This is because the liver preferentially resecretes only alpha tocopherol by way of the hepatic alpha tocopherol transfer protein alpha TTP the liver metabolizes and excretes all the other vitamin E variants which is why blood and cellular concentrations of other forms of vitamin E other than alpha tocopherol are ultimately lower L2120 Furthermore the term alpha tocopherol generally refers to a group of eight possible stereoisomers which is often called all rac tocopherol for being a racemic mixture of all eight stereoisomers T166 L2250 Of the eight stereoisomers the RRR alpha tocopherol or sometimes referred to as the d alpha tocopherol stereoisomer is the naturally occurring form of alpha tocopherol that is perhaps best recognized by the alpha TTP T166 L2250 and has been reported to demonstrate approximately twice the systemic availability of all rac tocopherol L2250 As a result often times but certainly not always the discussion of vitamin E at least within the context of using the vitamin for health related indications is generally in reference to the use of RRR or d alpha tocopherol",
