                "pharmacodynamics": "In two phase 2 double blind pharmacodynamic studies 82 healthy volunteers were randomized to receive vaccinia vaccination with or without Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous Human VIGIV FDA Label In the first study the efficacy of 9000 U kg of VIGIV on the immunologic and local response to the freeze dried calf lymph smallpox vaccine Dryvax was evaluated FDA Label A total of 32 healthy subjects were randomized to receive single IV infusions of either VIGIV 9 000 U kg or placebo 0 9 Sodium Chloride Injection USP on Day 0 and either placebo or VIGIV 9 000 U kg concurrently with vaccinia Dryvax vaccination on Day 4 FDA Label In the second study 50 healthy subjects were randomized to receive a single IV infusion of either VIGIV 9 000 U kg VIGIV 24 000 U kg or placebo 0 9 Sodium Chloride Injection USP on Day 0 and either placebo or vaccinia Dryvax vaccination on Day 4 FDA Label The effect of VIGIV on the immunologic response to Dryvax was determined by measuring vaccinia antibody titer vaccinia IgG in plasma and comparing titer levels across all three treatment arms FDA Label In addition the effect of VIGIV on the local response tissue to Dryvax was assessed by evaluating the size of the pox reaction as well as the area of erythema and induration following vaccination FDA Label VIGIV 9 000 U kg and 24 000 U kg reduced the local and immunological response to vaccinia vaccination when it was administered 4 days prior to vaccination compared to vaccination alone FDA Label This is consistent with the hypothesis that VIGIV can neutralize vaccinia virus in vivo FDA Label In addition infusions of VIGIV of up to 24 000 U kg were well tolerated FDA Label",
