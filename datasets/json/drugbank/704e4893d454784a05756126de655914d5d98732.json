                "pharmacodynamics": "Topical applications consisting of the individual active ingredients of nicoboxil and nonivamide at doses considered to be therapeutic are generally not considered readily available commercially A32785 Subsequently the pharmacodynamics of nicoboxil are considered useful in commercially available combination products largely because they combine with those of nonivamide to offer a synergistic effect from the unique complementary actions of these two agents F11 Subsequently nonivamide is a synthetic capsaicin analog with analgesic properties which are assumed to result from the depletion of Substance P in the peripheral nociceptive C fibres and A delta nerve fibers upon repetitive topical application F11 Resultant stimulation of afferent nerve endings in the skin evidently causes a dilatory effect on the surrounding blood vessels accompanied by an intense long lasting sensation of warmth associated with the nonivamide use F11 Given the proposed effect of nonivamide it is believed that nicoboxil is a vitamin of the B complex F12 that possesses vasodilating properties facilitated by prostaglandin F11 The observed hyperaemic increased blood flow effect of nicoboxil occurs earlier and is described as being more intense than the nonivamide hyperaemic effect F11 Nicoboxil and nonivamide are consequently generally indicated as a combination product because the pharmacodynamics of nicoboxil are considered useful as a complement to those of nonivamide and vice versa F11 A32785 In essence both compounds induce vasodilation by different effects and therefore have complementary abilities inducing increased blood flow thus hastening the hyperaemic skin reaction F16",
