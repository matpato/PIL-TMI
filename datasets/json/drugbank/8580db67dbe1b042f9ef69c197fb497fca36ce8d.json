                "pharmacodynamics": "Yohimbine is an indolalkylamine alkaloid with chemical similarity to reserpine Yohimbine blocks presynaptic alpha 2 adrenergic receptors Its action on peripheral blood vessels resembles that of reserpine though it is weaker and of short duration Yohimbine s peripheral autonomic nervous system effect is to increase parasympathetic cholinergic and decrease sympathetic adrenergic activity It is to be noted that in male sexual performance erection is linked to cholinergic activity and to alpha 2 adrenergic blockade which may theoretically result in increased penile inflow decreased penile outflow or both Yohimbine exerts a stimulating action on the mood and may increase anxiety Such actions have not been adequately studied or related to dosage although they appear to require high doses of the drug Yohimbine has a mild anti diuretic action probably via stimulation of hypothalmic center and release of posterior pituitary hormone Reportedly Yohimbine exerts no significant influence on cardiac stimulation and other effects mediated by beta adrenergic receptors Its effect on blood pressure if any would be to lower it however no adequate studies are at hand to quantitate this effect in terms of Yohimbine dosage",
