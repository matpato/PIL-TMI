            "therapeutic_indications": "There is currently no clinically approved and or marketed medicine that relies upon pidolic acid as an active ingredient for any formal therapeutic indication Although pidolic acid may be sold in a variety of non prescription over the counter dietary supplement products for cognitive or memory enhancement there are many studies that suggest that such products or such supplementation do not elicit any kind of cognitive benefit to users A32981 A32982 In fact the general suggestion for any such pidolic acid product is to exercise caution in their recommendation as much more research is necessary A32981 Pidolic acid and sodium pidolic acid are however used to some extent in skin and hair conditioning agents owing to their humectant characteristics F53",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Pidolic acid is a naturally occurring but little studied amino acid derivative that can be formed enzymatically or non enzymatically and participates as a biological intermediate in various chemical pathways A32991 L2729 Elevations of the acid in blood levels may be associated with problems of glutamine or glutathione metabolism L2729 Pidolic acid in general is found in large quantities in brain tissue and other tissues in bound form like skin L2729 Moreover pidolic acid in high enough levels can act as an acidogen capable of inducing acidosis and a metabotoxin that can result in adverse health effects L2729 Chronically elevated levels of pidolic acid are associated with at least five inborn errors of metabolism including 5 oxoprolinuria where 5 oxoproline is otherwise known as pidolic acid 5 oxoprolinase deficiency glutathione synthetase deficiency hawkinsinuria and propionic acidemia L2729 In particular abnormally high levels of organic acids like pidolic acid in the blood urine brain and or other tissues results in general metabolic acidosis L2729 Such acidosis generally occurs when arterial pH falls below 7 35 L2729 In infants the initial symptoms of acidosis consist of poor feeding vomiting loss of appetite weak muscle tone hypotonia and lack of energy L2729 Eventually acidosis and the symptoms of acidosis can lead to heart liver and kidney abnormalities seizures coma and possibly even death L2729 Many children who are afflicted with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development In adults acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches confusion feeling tired tremors sleepiness and seizures L2729 High levels of pidolic acid in the blood have also been demonstrated following acetaminophen overdose causing an increased level of acidity called a high anion gap metabolic acidosis A32993",
