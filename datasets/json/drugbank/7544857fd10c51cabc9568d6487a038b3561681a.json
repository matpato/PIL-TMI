                "pharmacodynamics": "ACP 104 is a small molecule drug candidate we are developing as a novel therapy for schizophrenia It is known that large amounts of ACP 104 or N desmethylclozapine are formed in the body after administration of clozapine That is clozapine is metabolized to ACP 104 We discovered that ACP 104 has a unique ability to stimulate m1 muscarinic receptors a key muscarinic receptor The m1 muscarinic receptors are widely known to play an important role in cognition Since clozapine itself blocks the m1 muscarinic receptor patients need to extensively metabolize clozapine into ACP 104 to stimulate this receptor and thereby overcome the blocking action of clozapine Administration of ACP 104 will avoid the variability of this metabolic process and the competing action of clozapine Like clozapine ACP 104 is a dopamine antagonist and a 5 HT2A inverse agonist We believe that ACP 104 represents a new approach to schizophrenia therapy that combines an atypical antipsychotic efficacy profile with the added advantage of beneficial cognitive effects",
