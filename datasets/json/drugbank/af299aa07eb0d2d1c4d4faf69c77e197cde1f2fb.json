            "therapeutic_indications": "Cyclosporine is approved for a variety of conditions Firstly it is approved for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in allogeneic kidney liver and heart transplants It is also used to prevent bone marrow transplant rejection For the above indications cyclosporine can be used in conjunction with azathioprine and corticosteroids Finally cyclosporine can be used in patients who have chronic transplant rejection and have received previous immunosuppressive therapy L3002 and to prevent or treat graft versus host disease GVHD L11097 Secondly cyclosporine is used for the treatment of patients with severe active rheumatoid arthritis RA when they no longer respond to methotrexate alone L3734 It can be used for the treatment of adult non immunocompromised patients with severe recalcitrant plaque psoriasis that have failed to respond to at least one systemic therapy or when systemic therapies are not tolerated or contraindicated L3734 The ophthalmic solution of cyclosporine is indicated to increase tear production in patients suffering from keratoconjunctivitis sicca L11097 In addition cyclosporine is approved for the treatment of steroid dependent and steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome due to glomerular diseases which may include minimal change nephropathy focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis or membranous glomerulonephritis L11097 Off label cyclosporine is commonly used for the treatment of various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions such as atopic dermatitis blistering disorders ulcerative colitis juvenile rheumatoid arthritis uveitis connective tissue diseases as well as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura A139 A174085 A189393 A189396 A189399",
