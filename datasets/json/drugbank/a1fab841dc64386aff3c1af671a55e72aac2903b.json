            "therapeutic_indications": "Glucose pharmaceutical formulations oral tablets injections are indicated for caloric supply and carbohydrate supplementation in case of nutrient deprivation It is also used in metabolic disorders such as hypoglycemia",

                "disease": "Oral LD50 value in rats is 25800mg kg The administration of glucose infusions can cause fluid and or solute overloading resulting in dilution of the serum electrolyte concentrations over hydration congested states or pulmonary oedema Hypersensitivity reactions may also occur including anaphylactic anaphylactoid reactions from oral tablets and intravenous infusions",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Blood glucose is an obligatory energy source in humans involved in various cellular activities and it also acts as a signalling molecule for diverse glucose sensing molecules and proteins Glucose undergoes oxidation into carbon dioxide water and yields energy molecules in the process of glycolysis and subsequent citric cycle and oxidative phosphorylation Glucose is readily converted into fat in the body which can be used as a source of energy as required Under a similar conversion into storage of energy glucose is stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen Glucose stores are mobilized in a regulated manner depending on the tissues metabolic demands Oral glucose tablets or injections serve to increase the supply of glucose and oral glucose administration is more effective in stimulating insulin secretion because it stimulates the incretin hormones from the gut which promotes insulin secretion",
