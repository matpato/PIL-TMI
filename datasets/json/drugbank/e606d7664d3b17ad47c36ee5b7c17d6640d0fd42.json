                "pharmacodynamics": "Warfarin is an anticoagulant as such it disrupts the coagulation cascade to reduce frequency and extent of thrombus formation label L6616 In patients with deep vein thrombosis or atrial fibrillation there is an increased risk of thrombus formation due to the reduced movement of blood T622 For patients with cardiac valve disease or valve replacements this increased coagulability is due to tissue damage Thrombi due to venous thrombosis can travel to the lungs and become pulmonary emboli blocking circulation to a portion of lung tissue Thrombi which form in the heart can travel to the brain and cause ischemic strokes Prevention of these events is the primary goal of warfarin therapy Limitation of thrombus formation is also a source of adverse effects In patients with atheroscelotic plaques rupture typically results in thrombus formation A179212 When these patients are anticoagulated plaque rupture can allow the escape of cholesterol from the lipid core in the form of atheroemboli or cholesterol microemboli These emboli are smaller than thrombi and block smaller vessels usually less than 200 \u03bcm in diameter The consequences of this are varied and depend on the location of the blockage Effects include visual disturbances acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease central nervous system ischemia and purple or blue toe syndrome label A179212 Blue toe syndrome can be reversed if it has not progressed to tissue necrosis but the other effects of microemboli are often permanent Antocoagulation appears to mediate warfarin related nephropathy a seemingly spontaneous kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease associated with warfarin therapy A179215 Nephropathy in this case appears to be due to increased passage of red blood cells through the glomerulus and subsequent blockage of renal tubules with red blood cell casts This is worsened or possibly triggered by pre existing kidney damage Increased risk of warfarin related nephropathy occurs at INRs over 3 0 but risk does not increase as a function of INR beyond this point Warfarin has been linked to the development of calciphylaxis label This is thought to be due to warfarin s inhibition of vitamin K VKA recycling as VKA is needed for the carboxylation of matrix Gla protein A179218 This protein is an anti calcification factor and its inhibition through preventing the carboxylation step in its production leads to a shift in calcification balance in favor of calciphylaxis Tissue necrosis can occur early on in warfarin therapy label This is attributable to half lives of the clotting factors impacted by inhibition of vitamin K recycling label A179221 Proteins C and S are anticoagulation factors with half lives of 8 and 24 hours respectively The coagulation factors IX X VII and thrombin factor II have half lives of 24 36 6 and 50 hours respectively This means proteins C and S are inactivated sooner than pro coagulation proteins with the exception of factor VII resulting in a pro thrombotic state for the first few days of therapy Thrombi which form in this time period can occlude arterioles in various locations blocking blood flow and causing tissue necrosis due to ischemia",
