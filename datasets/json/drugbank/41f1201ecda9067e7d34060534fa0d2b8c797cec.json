            "therapeutic_indications": "Indicated for the treatment of adults with chronic hepatitis C virus HCV infection typically in combination with sofosbuvir in patients with HCV genotype 1 without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis and in combination with peginterferon alfa Peg IFN alfa and ribavirin RBV in patients with HCV genotype 1 or 4 without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis Resistance Reduced susceptibility to simeprevir was most commonly associated with the viral NS3 Q80K polymorphism Amino acid substitutions at NS3 positions S122 R155 and or D168 are also shown to reduce susceptibility to simeprevir in genotype 1a b patients",
