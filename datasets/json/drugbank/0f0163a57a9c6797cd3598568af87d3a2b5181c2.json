                "disease": "Clinical Toxicity and Overdose The oral LD sub 50 sub ranges from 415 to 740mg kg in mice and 560 to 810 mg kg in rats The oral LD sub 50 sub in dogs is considered to be in excess of 50 mg kg A dose of 360 mg kg resulted in lethality in monkeys The intravenous LD sub 50 sub is 60 mg kg in mice and 38 mg kg in rats Cases of overdose from doses ranging from less than 1 g to 18 g have been reported with diltiazem with several cases involving multiple drug ingestions resulting in death Overdoses were associated with bradycardia hypotension heart block and cardiac failure that may manifest as dizziness lightheadedness and fatigue L6289 Actual treatment and dosage should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician Diltiazem overdose should be responded with appropriate supportive measures and gastrointestinal decontamination Bradycardia and heart block can be treated with atropine at doses ranging from 0 60 to 1 0 mg In the case of bradycardia if there is no response to vagal blockage cautious administration of isoproterenol should be considered Cardiac pacing can also be used to treat fixed high degree AV block In the case of heart failure blood pressure may be maintained with the use of fluids and vasopressors as well as inotropic agents such as isoproterenol dopamine or dobutamine Other appropriate measures include ventilatory support gastric lavage activated charcoal and or intravenous calcium Diltiazem does not appear to be removed by peritoneal or hemodialysis L10556 Non clinical toxicity In a 24 month study in rats receiving oral doses of up to 100 mg kg day there was no evidence of carcinogenicity There was also no mutagenic response _in vitro_ or _in vivo_ in mammalian cell assays or _in vitro_ bacterial assays No evidence of impaired fertility was observed in a study performed in male and female rats receiving oral doses of up to 100 mg kg day L10556 Pregnancy and Lactation In reproduction studies in animals administration of diltiazem at doses ranging from five to twenty times the daily recommended human therapeutic dose resulted in cases of the embryo and fetal lethality and skeletal abnormalities and an increase in the risk of stillbirths There have been no up to date controlled studies that investigated the use of diltiazem in pregnant women The use of diltiazem in pregnant women should be undertaken only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus L10556 Diltiazem is excreted in human milk where one report suggests that the concentrations in breast milk may approximate serum levels therefore the decision should be made to either discontinue nursing or the use of the drug after careful consideration of the clinical necessity of diltiazem therapy in the nursing mother L10556 Use in special populations As there is limited information on the variable effects of diltiazem in geriatric patients the initial therapy of diltiazem should involve the low end of the dosing range reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy Currently there are no specific dosing guidelines for patients with renal or hepatic impairment L10556",

                "pharmacodynamics": "Diltiazem is an antihypertensive and vasodilating agent that works by relaxing the vascular muscle and reducing blood pressure This is related to the long term therapeutic effects as lowering the blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non fatal cardiovascular events primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions L10556 Diltiazem inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium ions across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes during depolarization Diltiazem is classified as a negative inotrope decreased force and negative chronotrope decreased rate L6289 It is also considered a rate control drug as it reduces heart rate A178432 T28 Diltiazem is exerts hemodynamic actions by reducing blood pressure systemic vascular resistance the rate pressure product and coronary vascular resistance while increasing coronary blood flow L6292 Diltiazem decreases sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction in isolated tissues and has a negative inotropic effect in isolated preparations L10556 In supraventricular tachycardia diltiazem prolongs AV nodal refractories L6292 As the magnitude of blood pressure reduction is related to the degree of hypertension the antihypertensive effect of diltiazem is most pronounced in individuals with hypertension In a randomized double blind parallel group dose response study involving patients with essential hypertension there was a reduction in the diastolic blood pressure by 1 9 5 4 6 1 and 8 6 mmHg in the patients receiving diltiazem at doses of 120 240 360 and 540 mg respectively In patients receiving placebo there was a reduction in the diastolic blood pressure by 2 6 mmHg In a randomized double blind study involving patients with chronic stable angina variable doses of diltiazem administered at night all caused an increased exercise tolerance in the after 21 hours compared to placebo L10556 In the NORDIL study of patients with hypertension the therapeutic effectiveness of diltiazem in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was assessed A178432 When using the combined primary endpoint as fatal and non fatal stroke myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular death fatal and non fatal stroke was shown to be reduced by 25 in the diltiazem group Although the clinical significance to this effect remains unclear it is suggested that diltiazem may exert a protective role against cerebral stroke in hypertensive patients A178432",
