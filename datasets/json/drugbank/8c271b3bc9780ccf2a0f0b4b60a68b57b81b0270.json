                "pharmacodynamics": "Vidarabine is a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue with i in vitro i and i in vivo i inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 HSV 1 2 HSV 2 and varicella zoster virus VZV The inhibitory activity of Vidarabine is highly selective due to its affinity for the enzyme thymidine kinase TK encoded by HSV and VZV This viral enzyme converts Vidarabine into Vidarabine monophosphate a nucleotide analogue The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes i In vitro i Vidarabine triphosphate stops the DNA replication of herpes virus by being incorporated into the DNA strand and preventing the formation of phosphodiester bridges between bases This ultimately leads to destabilization of the viral DNA strands",
