                "pharmacodynamics": "Various studies have shown pizotifen to be effective in the prophylaxis of migraines in reducing the frequency and severity of vascular headaches A32536 Evidence from studies _in vivo_ and _in vitro_ demonstrate antagonistic actions towards serotonin and histamine Pizotifen blocks the postsynaptic 5 HT2 receptors as supported by antagonism of several direct agonists of 5 HT receptors A32538 It is an antagonist at histamine H1 receptors and is weakly anticholinergic A32550 It also binds to \u03b11 and \u03b12 adrenergic receptors and dopamine receptors A32550 Pizotifen elicits a minimal effect as an epinephrine or bradykinin antagonist L2292 Pizotifen exhibits weak sedative properties in mouse and monkey studies as indicated by inhibition of locomotion and potentiation of barbiturates without changes in cardiac or respiratory rates L2292 In dogs intravenous administration of pizotifen cause rapid hypotension but was reversed to normal within 30 minutes L2292 Pizotifen was shown to inhibit serotonin uptake in the isolated perfused cat spleen and _in vivo_ inhibits serotonin induced contractions in rat uterus and cat nictiating membrane A32533 In contrast pizotifen demonstrated a venoconstrictor activity _in vivo_ when orally or intravenously administered to saphenous veins in conscious dogs A32537 Pizotifen has the potential to stimulate the appetite and may cause weight gain upon treatment A32533 In a double blind clinical study of patients with mild to moderate depression treatment of pizotifen led to clinical improvement of the depressive symptoms However deterioration of the schizophrenic emotional symptoms was also observed in patients with depression and chronic schizophrenia A32532 This indicates that pizotifen may potentially improve the symptoms of patients with depressions in conjunction with migraines A32532 Neuroprotective effect of pizotifen was investigated _in vitro_ in a mouse cell model of Huntington s disease HD According to a chemical screen of a mouse HdhQ111 Q111 striatal cell model of HD treatment of pizotifen was associated with increased ATP levels and decreased activation of caspase 3 leading to enhanced cell viability A32539 Transient activation of ERK signalling pathway lasting for less than 3 hours was also observed In the R6 2 transgenic mouse model of HD rotarod performance of the mouse treated with pizotifen was seen accompanied by an increase in DARPP 32 protein expression and restoration of striatal area A32539 However these effects being reflected _in vivo_ are not established",
