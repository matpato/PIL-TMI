            "therapeutic_indications": "Gelatin is used for weight loss and for treating osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis and brittle bones osteoporosis Some people also use it for strengthening bones joints and fingernails Gelatin is also used for improving hair condition and to shorten the recovery after exercise and sports related injury L2113 Gelatin is used in preparations of foods cosmetics and medicine L2113 Plasma volume expander in hypovolaemic shock L2115 Haemostatic L2115 Gelatin based hydrogels are being used in drug delivery and tissue engineering because they are able to promote cell adhesion and proliferation In addition these hydrogels can be used as wound dressings because of their attractive fluid absorbance properties Manufacturing technologies such as ultraviolet stereolithography and two photon polymerization can be used to prepare structures containing photosensitive gelatin based hydrogels L2111",
