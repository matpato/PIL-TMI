            "therapeutic_indications": "Propoxycaine is a local anesthetic medication It was used beginning in the 1950s during dental procedures L1591 It has been combined with procaine to accelerate its onset of action and provide longer lasting anesthetic effect L1592 It was produced for use when amide local anesthetics were contraindicated due to allergy or when several amide anesthetics were unsuccessful L1592",

                "disease": "The toxicity of this medication 7 8 times higher than that of procaine has prevented this medication from being used on its own L1592 Ester type local anesthetics are much more likely to cause an allergic reaction compared to the amide group local anesthetics because of the formation of PABA Para aminobenzoic acid during the metabolic process PABA may cause allergic reactions that range from urticaria to anaphylaxis PABA is also formed during the metabolism of methylparaben a common preservative that is normally found in multi dose vials including lidocaine MDV amide type local anesthetic L1592 L1593",
