                "pharmacodynamics": "Cetrorelix is a synthetic decapeptide with gonadotropin releasing hormone GnRH antagonistic activity GnRH induces the production and release of luteinizing hormone LH and follicle stimulating hormone FSH from the gonadotrophic cells of the anterior pituitary Due to a positive estradiol E2 feedback at midcycle GnRH liberation is enhanced resulting in an LH surge This LH surge induces the ovulation of the dominant follicle resumption of oocyte meiosis and subsequently luteinization as indicated by rising progesterone levels Cetrorelix competes with natural GnRH for binding to membrane receptors on pituitary cells and thus controls the release of LH and FSH in a dose dependent manner",
