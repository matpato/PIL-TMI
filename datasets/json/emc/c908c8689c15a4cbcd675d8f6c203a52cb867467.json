                "disease": "Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6 1 When ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of other PIs consult the Summary of Product Characteristics of the co administered protease inhibitor for contraindications Ritonavir should not be given as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent to patients with decompensated liver disease In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A and CYP2D6 mediated biotransformations The following medicines are contraindicated when used with ritonavir and unless otherwise noted the contraindication is based on the potential for ritonavir to inhibit metabolism of the co administered medicinal product resulting in increased exposure to the co administered medicinal product and risk of clinically significant adverse effects The enzyme modulating effect of ritonavir may be dose dependent For some products contraindications may be more relevant when ritonavir is used as an antiretroviral agent than when ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer e g rifabutin and voriconazole Medicinal Product Class Medicinal Products within Class Rationale Concomitant medicinal product levels increased or decreased 1 Adrenoreceptor Antagonist Alfuzosin Increased plasma concentrations of alfuzosin which may lead to severe hypotension see section 4 5 Analgesics Pethidine piroxicam propoxyphene Increased plasma concentrations of norpethidine piroxicam and propoxyphene Thereby increasing the risk of serious respiratory depression or haematologic abnormalities or other serious adverse effects from these agents Antianginal Ranolazine Increased plasma concentrations of ranolazine which may increase the potential for serious and or life threatening reactions see section 4 5 Anticancer Neratinib Increased plasma concentrations of neratinib which may increase the potential for serious and or life threatening reactions including hepatotoxicity see section 4 5 Venetoclax Increased plasma concentrations of venetoclax Increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome at the dose initiation and during the dose titration phase see section 4 5 Antiarrhythmics Amiodarone bepridil dronedarone encainide flecainide propafenone quinidine Increased plasma concentrations of amiodarone bepridil dronedarone encainide flecainide propafenone quinidine Thereby increasing the risk of arrhythmias or other serious adverse effects from these agents Antibiotic Fusidic acid Increased plasma concentrations of fusidic acid and ritonavir Antifungal Voriconazole Concomitant use of ritonavir 400 mg twice daily and more and voriconazole is contraindicated due to a reduction in voriconazole plasma concentrations and possible loss of effect see section 4 5 Antihistamines Astemizole terfenadine Increased plasma concentrations of astemizole and terfenadine Thereby increasing the risk of serious arrhythmias from these agents Anti gout Colchicine Potential for serious and or life threatening reactions in patients with renal and or hepatic impairment see sections 4 4 and 4 5 Antimycobacterial Rifabutin Concomitant use of ritonavir 500 mg twice daily dosed as an antiretroviral agent and rifabutin due to an increase of rifabutin serum concentrations and risk of adverse reactions including uveitis see section 4 4 Recommendations regarding use of ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer with rifabutin are noted in section 4 5 Antipsychotics Neuroleptics Lurasidone Increased plasma concentrations of lurasidone which may increase the potential for serious and or life threatening reactions see section 4 5 Clozapine pimozide Increased plasma concentrations of clozapine and pimozide Thereby increasing the risk of serious haematologic abnormalities or other serious adverse effects from these agents Quetiapine Increased plasma concentrations of quetiapine which may lead to coma The concomitant administration with quetiapine is contraindicated see section 4 5 Ergot derivatives Dihydroergotamine ergonovine ergotamine methylergonovine Increased plasma concentrations of ergot derivatives leading to acute ergot toxicity including vasospasm and ischaemia GI motility agent Cisapride Increased plasma concentrations of cisapride Thereby increasing the risk of serious arrhythmias from this agent Lipid modifying agents HMG Co A reductase inhibitors Lovastatin simvastatin Increased plasma concentrations of lovastatin and simvastatin thereby increasing the risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis see section 4 5 Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein MTTP inhibitor Lomitapide Increased plasma concentrations of lomitapide see section 4 5 PDE5 inhibitor Avanafil Increased plasma concentrations of avanafil see sections 4 4 and 4 5 Sildenafil Contraindicated when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH only Increased plasma concentrations of sildenafil Thereby increasing the potential for sildenafil associated adverse events which include hypotension and syncope See section 4 4 and section 4 5 for co administration of sildenafil in patients with erectile dysfunction Vardenafil Increased plasma concentrations of vardenafil see sections 4 4 and 4 5 Sedatives hypnotics Clorazepate diazepam estazolam flurazepam oral midazolam and triazolam Increased plasma concentrations of clorazepate diazepam estazolam flurazepam oral midazolam and triazolam Thereby increasing the risk of extreme sedation and respiratory depression from these agents For caution on parenterally administered midazolam see section 4 5 Ritonavir medicinal product level decreased Herbal preparation St John s wort Herbal preparations containing St John s wort Hypericum perforatum due to the risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of ritonavir see section 4 5",
